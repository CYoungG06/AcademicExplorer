While\nrecent scaling laws have sought to understand how LLMs scale with respect to\nmodel size, pre-training data, and computational resources, we focus on\nunderstanding how model compression affects the performance of a pre-trained\nLLM on downstream tasks. We empirically examine the effects of structured model\ncompression on LLMs through over $1000$ experiments across eight models with\nsizes ranging from $0.5B$ to $14B$ parameters. Our findings indicate that the\ntest cross-entropy loss increases quadratically with the compression ratio,\nwhereas performance on downstream tasks declines only linearly. Our study\nemphasizes the importance of recovery fine-tuning in enhancing generation loss,\nshowing that the test loss of compressed LLMs can improve by up to 55% with\nrecovery fine-tuning. At higher compression ratios (up to 90%), compressed LLMs\ndemonstrate a speed increase of 60% during inference compared to their\nuncompressed counterparts, compensating for the performance degradation at this\nlevel. However, for smaller models ($\\le 7B$), the computational gains are\nlimited, peaking at just 35%. We conclude that model compression can be highly\nbeneficial for larger models, especially when a smaller model within the same\ncomputational budget is not available.

Existing studies\noften optimize these metrics separately, typically by first applying quality\nfiltering and then adjusting data proportions. However, these approaches\noverlook the inherent trade-off between quality and diversity, necessitating\ntheir joint consideration. Given a fixed training quota, it is essential to\nevaluate both the quality of each data point and its complementary effect on\nthe overall dataset. In this paper, we introduce a unified data selection\nframework called QuaDMix, which automatically optimizes the data distribution\nfor LLM pretraining while balancing both quality and diversity. Specifically,\nwe first propose multiple criteria to measure data quality and employ domain\nclassification to distinguish data points, thereby measuring overall diversity.\nQuaDMix then employs a unified parameterized data sampling function that\ndetermines the sampling probability of each data point based on these quality\nand diversity related labels. To accelerate the search for the optimal\nparameters involved in the QuaDMix framework, we conduct simulated experiments\non smaller models and use LightGBM for parameters searching, inspired by the\nRegMix method. Our experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate\nthat QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across\nmultiple benchmarks. These results outperform the independent strategies for\nquality and diversity, highlighting the necessity and ability to balance data\nquality and diversity.",

Through extensive empirical studies\ninvolving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal\nscaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a\npower-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal\nbatch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex\noptimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size\nconditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We\ncontribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the\ncommunity. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the\nglobally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws\ndemonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training\ndata distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work\nthat unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts\nmodels and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter\nscaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization\nprocess demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one\nmillion NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and\nhyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in\ntotal.

Unlike existing methods that focus on\nsingle-stage optimization or rely on computationally intensive gradient\ncalculations, DELIFT operates efficiently across all stages. Central to our\napproach is a pairwise utility metric that quantifies how beneficial a data\nsample is for improving the model's responses to other samples, effectively\nmeasuring the informational value relative to the model's current capabilities.\nBy leveraging different submodular functions applied to this metric, DELIFT\nselects diverse and optimal subsets that are useful across all stages of\nfine-tuning.

Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge).

In efforts to\nbetter understand how to proceed, we study model performance at various compute\nbudgets and across multiple pre-training datasets created through data\nfiltering and deduplication. We find that, given appropriate modifications to\nthe training recipe, repeating existing aggressively filtered datasets for up\nto ten epochs can outperform training on the ten times larger superset for a\nsingle epoch across multiple compute budget orders of magnitude. While this\nfinding relies on repeating the dataset for many epochs, we also investigate\nrepeats within these datasets at the document level. We find that not all\ndocuments within a dataset are equal, and we can create better datasets\nrelative to a token budget by explicitly manipulating the counts of individual\ndocuments. We conclude by arguing that even as large language models scale,\ndata filtering remains an important direction of research.",

However, upon revisiting these methods, the\ndomain-similarity selection criteria demonstrates a diversity dilemma,\ni.e.dimensional collapse in the feature space, improving performance on the\ndomain-related tasks but causing severe degradation on generic performance. To\nprevent collapse and enhance diversity, we propose a DiverSified File selection\nalgorithm (DiSF), which selects the most decorrelated text files in the feature\nspace.

This work\naddresses this gap by studying how LLMs acquire factual knowledge during\npretraining. The findings reveal several important insights into the dynamics\nof factual knowledge acquisition during pretraining. First, counterintuitively,\nwe observe that pretraining on more data shows no significant improvement in\nthe model's capability to acquire and maintain factual knowledge. Next, there\nis a power-law relationship between training steps and forgetting of\nmemorization and generalization of factual knowledge, and LLMs trained with\nduplicated training data exhibit faster forgetting. Third, training LLMs with\nlarger batch sizes can enhance the models' robustness to forgetting. Overall,\nour observations suggest that factual knowledge acquisition in LLM pretraining\noccurs by progressively increasing the probability of factual knowledge\npresented in the pretraining data at each step. However, this increase is\ndiluted by subsequent forgetting. Based on this interpretation, we demonstrate\nthat we can provide plausible explanations for recently observed behaviors of\nLLMs, such as the poor performance of LLMs on long-tail knowledge and the\nbenefits of deduplicating the pretraining corpus.",

Building on previous work, we investigate this\nquestion in a controlled setting, where we study transformer models trained on\nsequences of $(x, f(x))$ pairs rather than natural language. Our empirical\nresults show transformers demonstrate near-optimal unsupervised model selection\ncapabilities, in their ability to first in-context identify different task\nfamilies and in-context learn within them when the task families are\nwell-represented in their pretraining data. However when presented with tasks\nor functions which are out-of-domain of their pretraining data, we demonstrate\nvarious failure modes of transformers and degradation of their generalization\nfor even simple extrapolation tasks.

While existing\nICL theories often assume structured training data resembling ICL tasks (e.g.,\nx-y pairs for linear regression), LLMs are typically trained unsupervised on\nunstructured text, such as web content, which lacks clear parallels to tasks\nlike word analogy. To address this gap, we examine what enables ICL in models\ntrained on unstructured data, focusing on critical sequence model requirements\nand training data structure. We find that many ICL capabilities can emerge\nsimply from co-occurrence of semantically related word pairs in unstructured\ndata; word analogy completion, for example, can provably arise purely through\nco-occurrence modeling, using classical language models like continuous bag of\nwords (CBOW), without needing positional information or attention mechanisms.\nHowever, positional information becomes crucial for logic reasoning tasks\nrequiring generalization to unseen tokens. Finally, we identify two cases where\nICL fails: one in logic reasoning tasks that require generalizing to new,\nunseen patterns, and another in analogy completion where relevant word pairs\nappear only in fixed training positions. These findings suggest that LLMs' ICL\nabilities depend heavily on the structural elements within their training data.",

The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the\nnumber of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been\nlinked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved.\nThese emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context\nlearning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific\ndebate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors,\nsuch as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What\nunderlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential,\nemergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about\ntheir definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we\nshed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the\nphenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world\nconsequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing\ninconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the\nconditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling\nlaws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting\nstrategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and\ninference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection.

In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the\nlens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We\ndemonstrate that the Transformer models with the same pre-training loss, but\ndifferent model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various\ndownstream tasks, with a fixed data corpus, tokenization, and model\narchitecture. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on\ncertain tasks -- regardless of the continuity of metrics -- when its\npre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this\nthreshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This\ninspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models\nwith lower pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be\npredicted by merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher\npre-training losses.",

However, relationships between the two abilities\nand how such relationships affect the emergence of ICL is unclear. In this\npaper, we take the first step by examining the pre-training dynamics of the\nemergence of ICL. With carefully designed metrics, we find that these two\nabilities are, in fact, competitive during pre-training. Moreover, we observe a\nstrong negative correlation between the competition and ICL performance.\nFurther analysis of common pre-training factors (i.e., model size, dataset\nsize, and data curriculum) demonstrates possible ways to manage the\ncompetition. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method\nto better integrate these two abilities for ICL at inference time. Through\nadaptive ensemble learning, the performance of ICL can be significantly\nboosted, enabling two small models to outperform a larger one with more than\ntwice the parameters.

To better understand how ICL integrates the examples\nwith the knowledge learned by the LLM during pre-training (i.e., pre-training\nknowledge) and how the examples impact ICL, this paper conducts a theoretical\nstudy in binary classification tasks. In particular, we introduce a\nprobabilistic model extending from the Gaussian mixture model to exactly\nquantify the impact of pre-training knowledge, label frequency, and label noise\non the prediction accuracy. Based on our analysis, when the pre-training\nknowledge contradicts the knowledge in the examples, whether ICL prediction\nrelies more on the pre-training knowledge or the examples depends on the number\nof examples. In addition, the label frequency and label noise of the examples\nboth affect the accuracy of the ICL prediction, where the minor class has a\nlower accuracy, and how the label noise impacts the accuracy is determined by\nthe specific noise level of the two classes.

Previous work curating in-context learners\nassumes that ICL emerges from a vast over-parametrization or the scale of\nmulti-task training. However, recent theoretical work attributes the ICL\nability to concept-dependent training data and creates functional in-context\nlearners even in small-scale, synthetic settings.\n  In this work, we practically explore this newly identified axis of ICL\nquality. We propose Concept-aware Training (CoAT), a framework for constructing\ntraining scenarios that make it beneficial for the LM to learn to utilize the\nanalogical reasoning concepts from demonstrations. We find that by using CoAT,\npre-trained transformers can learn to better utilise new latent concepts from\ndemonstrations and that such ability makes ICL more robust to the functional\ndeficiencies of the previous models. Finally, we show that concept-aware\nin-context learning is more effective for a majority of new tasks when compared\nto traditional instruction tuning, resulting in a performance comparable to the\nprevious in-context learners using magnitudes of more training data.",

The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the\nnumber of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been\nlinked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved.\nThese emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context\nlearning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific\ndebate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors,\nsuch as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What\nunderlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential,\nemergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about\ntheir definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we\nshed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the\nphenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world\nconsequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing\ninconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the\nconditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling\nlaws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting\nstrategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and\ninference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection. However,\nemergence is not inherently positive. As AI systems gain autonomous reasoning\ncapabilities, they also develop harmful behaviors, including deception,\nmanipulation, and reward hacking.

To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is\ncomputationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language\ntokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range\ndependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution\nshort-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an\nunlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer\ntokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a\nmanageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time\nand memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to\nsupport the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on\nlong video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet\neffective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.

To generate high-quality, dynamic,\nand temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel\nframework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for\nlong video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range\ntemporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model.\nSpecifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of\nthe DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and\nbalancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive\nnorm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual\nunits from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during\nvideo generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced\nfrom the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent\ntokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on\neight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in\ndynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on\nthe remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process.

            "abstract": "With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved\nimpressive quality. But generating temporal consistent long videos is still\nchallenging. A majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate long videos\nin an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on\nlast frames of previous clip. However, existing approaches all involve\nbidirectional computations, which restricts the receptive context of each\nautoregression step, and results in the model lacking long-term dependencies.\nInspired from the huge success of large language models (LLMs) and following\nGPT (generative pre-trained transformer), we bring causal (i.e.,\nunidirectional) generation into VDMs, and use past frames as prompt to generate\nfuture frames. For Causal Generation, we introduce causal temporal attention\ninto VDM, which forces each generated frame to depend on its previous frames.\nFor Frame as Prompt, we inject the conditional frames by concatenating them\nwith noisy frames (frames to be generated) along the temporal axis.\nConsequently, we present Video Diffusion GPT (ViD-GPT). Based on the two key\ndesigns, in each autoregression step, it is able to acquire long-term context\nfrom prompting frames concatenated by all previously generated frames.\nAdditionally, we bring the kv-cache mechanism to VDMs, which eliminates the\nredundant computation from overlapped frames, significantly boosting the\ninference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ViD-GPT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on long\nvideo generation.

Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational\nresources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion\ndynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic,\nand temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel\nframework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for\nlong video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range\ntemporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model.\nSpecifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of\nthe DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and\nbalancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive\nnorm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual\nunits from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during\nvideo generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced\nfrom the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent\ntokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on\neight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in\ndynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on\nthe remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process. In\naddition, ARLON achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation.\nDetailed analyses of the improvements in inference efficiency are presented,\nalongside a practical application that demonstrates the generation of long\nvideos using progressive text prompts.

To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is\ncomputationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language\ntokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range\ndependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution\nshort-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an\nunlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer\ntokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a\nmanageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time\nand memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to\nsupport the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on\nlong video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet\neffective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.

In this paper, we define IGV as a technology that\ncombines generative capabilities to produce diverse high-quality video content\nwith interactive features that enable user engagement through control signals\nand responsive feedback. We survey the current landscape of IGV applications,\nfocusing on three major domains: 1) gaming, where IGV enables infinite\nexploration in virtual worlds; 2) embodied AI, where IGV serves as a\nphysics-aware environment synthesizer for training agents in multimodal\ninteraction with dynamically evolving scenes; and 3) autonomous driving, where\nIGV provides closed-loop simulation capabilities for safety-critical testing\nand validation. To guide future development, we propose a comprehensive\nframework that decomposes an ideal IGV system into five essential modules:\nGeneration, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence. Furthermore, we\nsystematically analyze the technical challenges and future directions in\nrealizing each component for an ideal IGV system, such as achieving real-time\ngeneration, enabling open-domain control, maintaining long-term coherence,\nsimulating accurate physics, and integrating causal reasoning. We believe that\nthis systematic analysis will facilitate future research and development in the\nfield of IGV, ultimately advancing the technology toward more sophisticated and\npractical applications.",

In this paper, we propose\nMemory-efficient Bidirectional Transformer (MeBT) for end-to-end learning of\nlong-term dependency in videos and fast inference. Based on recent advances in\nbidirectional transformers, our method learns to decode the entire\nspatio-temporal volume of a video in parallel from partially observed patches.\nThe proposed transformer achieves a linear time complexity in both encoding and\ndecoding, by projecting observable context tokens into a fixed number of latent\ntokens and conditioning them to decode the masked tokens through the\ncross-attention.

These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks\nsuch as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive\nsurvey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our\nclassification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated\nto vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to\ngenerate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce\nmultimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective\ncapabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various\nmodalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive\nanalysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as\nits strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a\ncomprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the\nperformance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets.

As with\nother cross-modal tasks, the key challenge lies in modeling the correspondence\nbetween audio and visual modalities, which differ in representation but provide\ncomplementary cues -- video offers spatial and motion context, while audio\nconveys engine activity beyond the visual field.

However, it is still under-explored whether the transformer-based\ndiffuser can efficiently denoise the Gaussian noises towards superb multimodal\ncontent creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AV-DiT, a novel and\nefficient audio-visual diffusion transformer designed to generate high-quality,\nrealistic videos with both visual and audio tracks. To minimize model\ncomplexity and computational costs, AV-DiT utilizes a shared DiT backbone\npre-trained on image-only data, with only lightweight, newly inserted adapters\nbeing trainable. This shared backbone facilitates both audio and video\ngeneration. Specifically, the video branch incorporates a trainable temporal\nattention layer into a frozen pre-trained DiT block for temporal consistency.\nAdditionally, a small number of trainable parameters adapt the image-based DiT\nblock for audio generation. An extra shared DiT block, equipped with\nlightweight parameters, facilitates feature interaction between audio and\nvisual modalities, ensuring alignment. Extensive experiments on the AIST++ and\nLandscape datasets demonstrate that AV-DiT achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in joint audio-visual generation with significantly fewer tunable\nparameters.

Previous methods primarily focus on\ndeveloping advanced architectures to facilitate effective audio-visual\ninteractions, without fully addressing the inherent challenges posed by audio\nnatures, \\emph{\\ie}, (1) feature confusion due to the overlapping nature of\naudio signals, and (2) audio-visual matching difficulty from the varied sounds\nproduced by the same object. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic\nDerivation and Elimination (DDESeg): a novel audio-visual segmentation\nframework. Specifically, to mitigate feature confusion, DDESeg reconstructs the\nsemantic content of the mixed audio signal by enriching the distinct semantic\ninformation of each individual source, deriving representations that preserve\nthe unique characteristics of each sound. To reduce the matching difficulty, we\nintroduce a discriminative feature learning module, which enhances the semantic\ndistinctiveness of generated audio representations. Considering that not all\nderived audio representations directly correspond to visual features (e.g.,\noff-screen sounds), we propose a dynamic elimination module to filter out\nnon-matching elements. This module facilitates targeted interaction between\nsounding regions and relevant audio semantics. By scoring the interacted\nfeatures, we identify and filter out irrelevant audio information, ensuring\naccurate audio-visual alignment.

We also propose a simple yet effective approach\ncombining balanced training with negative samples and classifier-guided\nsimilarity learning.

This\napproach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art\nperformance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of\nVILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns\ndiscrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances\nvisual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar\nquality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset.

However,\nexisting works have primarily focused on structured environments relying on\nmeticulously crafted representations of tasks, thereby limiting the agent's\nability to generalize skills across tasks. In this paper, we aim to enhance the\ngeneralization capabilities of agents in open-ended text-based learning\nenvironments by integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Large Language\nModels (LLMs). We investigate three types of agents: (i) RL-based agents that\nutilize natural language for state and action representations to find the best\ninteraction strategy, (ii) LLM-based agents that leverage the model's general\nknowledge and reasoning through prompting, and (iii) hybrid LLM-assisted RL\nagents that combine these two strategies to improve agents' performance and\ngeneralization. To support the development and evaluation of these agents, we\nintroduce PharmaSimText, a novel benchmark derived from the PharmaSim virtual\npharmacy environment designed for practicing diagnostic conversations. Our\nresults show that RL-based agents excel in task completion but lack in asking\nquality diagnostic questions. In contrast, LLM-based agents perform better in\nasking diagnostic questions but fall short of completing the task. Finally,\nhybrid LLM-assisted RL agents enable us to overcome these limitations,\nhighlighting the potential of combining RL and LLMs to develop high-performing\nagents for open-ended learning environments.",

However, LLM-based agents lack specialization in\ntackling specific target problems, particularly in real-time dynamic\nenvironments. Additionally, deploying an LLM-based agent in practical scenarios\ncan be both costly and time-consuming. On the other hand, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approaches train agents that specialize in the target task but\noften suffer from low sampling efficiency and high exploration costs. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these challenges by\ntraining a smaller, specialized student RL agent using instructions from an\nLLM-based teacher agent. By incorporating the guidance from the teacher agent,\nthe student agent can distill the prior knowledge of the LLM into its own\nmodel. Consequently, the student agent can be trained with significantly less\ndata. Moreover, through further training with environment feedback, the student\nagent surpasses the capabilities of its teacher for completing the target task.\nWe conducted experiments on challenging MiniGrid and Habitat environments,\nspecifically designed for embodied AI research, to evaluate the effectiveness\nof our framework.

To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied\napproach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to\nan optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

We introduce a universal\nalgorithmic framework tailored for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations,\nkey distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We begin by\nreviewing the evolution from RL to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, setting the stage\nfor a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we\nelucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences\nmotivate a transition toward a novel, LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT.\nCentral to this work is the presentation of a robust and scalable MARFT\nframework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source\nimplementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections\nof the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges\nin MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies,\nthis work aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT\ntoward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation\nof the proposed framework is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.",

One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is\nexploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM\nagent designs struggle to contend with.

Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the\nquality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate\nhow LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning\nin-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than\nrelying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and\nrefining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a\nnaive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test\nperformance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%),\nand InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent\nachieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two\nextensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to\nidentify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection\nthat retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as\nin-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving\n91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific\ncomponents and prompts.

As the number\nof modalities increases, aligning all-modality models with human intentions --\nsuch as instruction following -- becomes a pressing challenge. In this work, we\nmake the first attempt to fine-tune all-modality models (i.e. input and output\nwith any modality, also named any-to-any models) using human preference data\nacross all modalities (including text, image, audio, and video), ensuring its\nbehavior aligns with human intentions. This endeavor presents several\nchallenges. First, there is no large-scale all-modality human preference data\nin existing open-source resources, as most datasets are limited to specific\nmodalities, predominantly text and image. Secondly, the effectiveness of binary\npreferences in RLHF for post-training alignment in complex all-modality\nscenarios remains an unexplored area. Finally, there is a lack of a systematic\nframework to evaluate the capabilities of all-modality models, particularly\nregarding modality selection and synergy. To address these challenges, we\npropose the align-anything framework, which includes meticulously annotated\n200k all-modality human preference data.

Existing methods largely use closed-vocabulary\nobject lists to mitigate or evaluate hallucinations in image captioning,\nignoring the long-tailed nature of hallucinations that occur in practice. To\nthis end, we propose a framework for addressing hallucinations in image\ncaptioning in the open-vocabulary setting. Our framework includes a new\nbenchmark, OpenCHAIR, that leverages generative foundation models to evaluate\nopen-vocabulary object hallucinations for image captioning, surpassing the\npopular and similarly-sized CHAIR benchmark in both diversity and accuracy.\nFurthermore, to mitigate open-vocabulary hallucinations without using a closed\nobject list, we propose MOCHa, an approach harnessing advancements in\nreinforcement learning. Our multi-objective reward function explicitly targets\nthe trade-off between fidelity and adequacy in generations without requiring\nany strong supervision. MOCHa improves a large variety of image captioning\nmodels, as captured by our OpenCHAIR benchmark and other existing metrics.

The problem makes existing MLLMs untrustworthy and thus\nimpractical in real-world (especially high-stakes) applications. To address the\nchallenge, we present RLHF-V, which enhances MLLM trustworthiness via behavior\nalignment from fine-grained correctional human feedback. Specifically, RLHF-V\ncollects human preference in the form of segment-level corrections on\nhallucinations, and performs dense direct preference optimization over the\nhuman feedback. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks in both automatic\nand human evaluation show that, RLHF-V can enable substantially more\ntrustworthy MLLM behaviors with promising data and computation efficiency.\nRemarkably, using 1.4k annotated data samples, RLHF-V significantly reduces the\nhallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8%, outperforming the concurrent\nLLaVA-RLHF trained on 10k annotated data. The final model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness among open-source MLLMs, and\nshows better robustness than GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations aroused from\nover-generalization.

While this issue is extensively researched in natural\nlanguage processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation\nof hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU),\nespecially in the context of image quality assessment tasks. We consider that\nthese hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the\nmodels. To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction\ndatabase, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations\nin low-level vision tasks. This database contains approximately 200K\nquestion-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types\nof instructions. Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure\nElimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region\nfeatures and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension\nabilities of the model in low-level vision tasks. Furthermore, we propose the\nEnhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase\nthe model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence\nof hallucination. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level\nvision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method\nsignificantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces\nhallucinations.

Currently, training-based solutions,\nlike direct preference optimization (DPO), leverage paired preference data to\nsuppress hallucinations. However, they risk sacrificing general reasoning\ncapabilities due to the likelihood displacement. Meanwhile, training-free\nsolutions, like contrastive decoding, achieve this goal by subtracting the\nestimated hallucination pattern from a distorted input. Yet, these handcrafted\nperturbations (e.g., add noise to images) may poorly capture authentic\nhallucination patterns. To avoid these weaknesses of existing methods, and\nrealize robust hallucination mitigation (i.e., maintaining general reasoning\nperformance), we propose a novel framework: Decoupling Contrastive Decoding\n(DCD). Specifically, DCD decouples the learning of positive and negative\nsamples in preference datasets, and trains separate positive and negative image\nprojections within the MLLM. The negative projection implicitly models real\nhallucination patterns, which enables vision-aware negative images in the\ncontrastive decoding inference stage. Our DCD alleviates likelihood\ndisplacement by avoiding pairwise optimization and generalizes robustly without\nhandcrafted degradation. Extensive ablations across hallucination benchmarks\nand general reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DCD, i.e., it\nmatches DPO's hallucination suppression while preserving general capabilities\nand outperforms the handcrafted contrastive decoding methods.",

Specifically, we introduce\nan image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features\nfrom images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where\nprompt-relevant content is highlighted while irrelevant distractions are\nsuppressed. Hallucinations can thus be mitigated with a calibrated logit\ndistribution that is from generative global features of the original image and\ndiscriminative local features of the augmented image. Extensive experiments\nshow the superiority of AGLA in LVLM hallucination mitigation, demonstrating\nits wide applicability across both discriminative and generative tasks.

Despite these\npromising developments, MLLMs often generate outputs that are inconsistent with\nthe visual content, a challenge known as hallucination, which poses substantial\nobstacles to their practical deployment and raises concerns regarding their\nreliability in real-world applications. This problem has attracted increasing\nattention, prompting efforts to detect and mitigate such inaccuracies. We\nreview recent advances in identifying, evaluating, and mitigating these\nhallucinations, offering a detailed overview of the underlying causes,\nevaluation benchmarks, metrics, and strategies developed to address this issue.\nAdditionally, we analyze the current challenges and limitations, formulating\nopen questions that delineate potential pathways for future research. By\ndrawing the granular classification and landscapes of hallucination causes,\nevaluation benchmarks, and mitigation methods, this survey aims to deepen the\nunderstanding of hallucinations in MLLMs and inspire further advancements in\nthe field. Through our thorough and in-depth review, we contribute to the\nongoing dialogue on enhancing the robustness and reliability of MLLMs,\nproviding valuable insights and resources for researchers and practitioners\nalike.

            "abstract": "The task of Question Answering (QA) has attracted significant research\ninterest for long. Its relevance to language understanding and knowledge\nretrieval tasks, along with the simple setting makes the task of QA crucial for\nstrong AI systems. Recent success on simple QA tasks has shifted the focus to\nmore complex settings. Among these, Multi-Hop QA (MHQA) is one of the most\nresearched tasks over the recent years. In broad terms, MHQA is the task of\nanswering natural language questions that involve extracting and combining\nmultiple pieces of information and doing multiple steps of reasoning. An\nexample of a multi-hop question would be \"The Argentine PGA Championship record\nholder has won how many tournaments worldwide?\". Answering the question would\nneed two pieces of information: \"Who is the record holder for Argentine PGA\nChampionship tournaments?\" and \"How many tournaments did [Answer of Sub Q1]\nwin?\". The ability to answer multi-hop questions and perform multi step\nreasoning can significantly improve the utility of NLP systems. Consequently,\nthe field has seen a surge with high quality datasets, models and evaluation\nstrategies. The notion of 'multiple hops' is somewhat abstract which results in\na large variety of tasks that require multi-hop reasoning. This leads to\ndifferent datasets and models that differ significantly from each other and\nmakes the field challenging to generalize and survey. We aim to provide a\ngeneral and formal definition of the MHQA task, and organize and summarize\nexisting MHQA frameworks. We also outline some best practices for building MHQA\ndatasets. This book provides a systematic and thorough introduction as well as\nthe structuring of the existing attempts to this highly interesting, yet quite\nchallenging task.",

The complexity of such\nquestions could stem from questions being compositional, hybrid evidence, or\nambiguity in questions. While retrieval performance for classical QA tasks is\nwell explored, their capabilities for heterogeneous complex retrieval tasks,\nespecially in an open-domain setting, and the impact on downstream QA\nperformance, are relatively unexplored. To address this, in this work, we\npropose a benchmark composing diverse complex QA tasks and provide a toolkit to\nevaluate state-of-the-art pre-trained dense and sparse retrieval models in an\nopen-domain setting. We observe that late interaction models and surprisingly\nlexical models like BM25 perform well compared to other pre-trained dense\nretrieval models. In addition, since context-based reasoning is critical for\nsolving complex QA tasks, we also evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nand the impact of retrieval performance on their reasoning capabilities.\nThrough experiments, we observe that much progress is to be made in retrieval\nfor complex QA to improve downstream QA performance.

Recent literature proposes Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) which\nintegrates knowledge graphs with an LLM-based traversal agent to substantially\nenhance document retrieval quality. However, KGP requires costly fine-tuning\nwith large datasets and remains prone to hallucination. In this paper, we\npropose CuriousLLM, an enhancement that integrates a curiosity-driven reasoning\nmechanism into an LLM agent. This mechanism enables the agent to generate\nrelevant follow-up questions, thereby guiding the information retrieval process\nmore efficiently. Central to our approach is the development of the new\nFollow-upQA dataset, which includes questions and supporting evidence as input,\nwith follow-up questions serving as ground truths. These follow-up questions\neither inquire about what is still missing to fully answer the user's query or\nuse special tokens to signify that the retrieved evidence is sufficient. Our\nexperiments show that CuriousLLM significantly boosts LLM performance in\nmulti-document question answering (MD-QA), circumventing the substantial\ncomputational costs and latency from the original KGP framework.",

While prior work has demonstrated the importance of improving knowledge\nretrieval for boosting generation quality, the role of knowledge selection\nremains less clear. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of how\nknowledge selection influences downstream generation performance in RAG\nsystems. By simulating different retrieval and selection conditions through a\ncontrolled mixture of gold and distractor knowledge, we assess the impact of\nthese factors on generation outcomes. Our findings indicate that the downstream\ngenerator model's capability, as well as the complexity of the task and\ndataset, significantly influence the impact of knowledge selection on the\noverall RAG system performance. In typical scenarios, improving the knowledge\nrecall score is key to enhancing generation outcomes, with the knowledge\nselector providing a limited additional benefit when a strong generator model\nis used on clear, well-defined tasks. For weaker generator models or more\nambiguous tasks and datasets, the knowledge F1 score becomes a critical factor,\nand the knowledge selector plays a more prominent role in improving overall\nperformance.",

We examined student engagement with 78 online\nvideos that we created and were incorporated into a one-semester blended\nintroductory mechanics course at the Georgia Institute of Technology. We found\nthat students were more engaged with videos that supported laboratory\nactivities than with videos that presented lecture content. In particular, the\npercentage of students accessing laboratory videos was consistently greater\nthan 80 percent throughout the semester while the percentage of students\naccessing lecture videos dropped to less than 40 percent by the end of the\nterm. Moreover, students were more likely to access the entirety of a\nlaboratory video than a lecture video. Our results suggest that students may\naccess videos based on perceived value: students appear to consider the\nlaboratory videos as essential for successfully completing the laboratories\nwhile students appear to consider the lecture videos as something more akin to\nsupplementary material. We found there was little correlation between student\nengagement with the videos and the performance in the course. In addition, an\nexamination of the in-video content suggests that students focus more on\nconcrete information that is explicitly required for assignment completion\n(e.g., actions required to complete laboratory work, or formulas/mathematical\nexpressions needed to solve particular problems) and less on content that is\nconsidered more conceptual in nature. The results of the study suggest ways in\nwhich instructors may revise courses to better support student learning.",

In this process, VStore\nderives an optimal set of video formats, optimizing for different resources in\na progressive manner.

A comprehensive evaluation benchmark for video\ngeneration is indispensable for two reasons: 1) Existing metrics do not fully\nalign with human perceptions; 2) An ideal evaluation system should provide\ninsights to inform future developments of video generation. To this end, we\npresent VBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite that dissects \"video generation\nquality\" into specific, hierarchical, and disentangled dimensions, each with\ntailored prompts and evaluation methods. VBench has several appealing\nproperties: 1) Comprehensive Dimensions: VBench comprises 16 dimensions in\nvideo generation (e.g., subject identity inconsistency, motion smoothness,\ntemporal flickering, and spatial relationship, etc). The evaluation metrics\nwith fine-grained levels reveal individual models' strengths and weaknesses. 2)\nHuman Alignment: We also provide a dataset of human preference annotations to\nvalidate our benchmarks' alignment with human perception, for each evaluation\ndimension respectively. 3) Valuable Insights: We look into current models'\nability across various evaluation dimensions, and various content types. We\nalso investigate the gaps between video and image generation models. 4)\nVersatile Benchmarking: VBench++ supports evaluating text-to-video and\nimage-to-video. We introduce a high-quality Image Suite with an adaptive aspect\nratio to enable fair evaluations across different image-to-video generation\nsettings. Beyond assessing technical quality, VBench++ evaluates the\ntrustworthiness of video generative models, providing a more holistic view of\nmodel performance. 5) Full Open-Sourcing: We fully open-source VBench++ and\ncontinually add new video generation models to our leaderboard to drive forward\nthe field of video generation.",

However, their\npre-trained architectures often reveal limitations in specialized contexts,\nincluding restricted reasoning capacities, ethical uncertainties, and\nsuboptimal domain-specific performance. These challenges necessitate advanced\npost-training language models (PoLMs) to address these shortcomings, such as\nOpenAI-o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1 (collectively known as Large Reasoning Models, or\nLRMs). This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of PoLMs,\nsystematically tracing their evolution across five core paradigms: Fine-tuning,\nwhich enhances task-specific accuracy; Alignment, which ensures alignment with\nhuman preferences; Reasoning, which advances multi-step inference despite\nchallenges in reward design; Efficiency, which optimizes resource utilization\namidst increasing complexity; and Integration and Adaptation, which extend\ncapabilities across diverse modalities while addressing coherence issues.\nCharting progress from ChatGPT's foundational alignment strategies to\nDeepSeek-R1's innovative reasoning advancements, we illustrate how PoLMs\nleverage datasets to mitigate biases, deepen reasoning capabilities, and\nenhance domain adaptability. Our contributions include a pioneering synthesis\nof PoLM evolution, a structured taxonomy categorizing techniques and datasets,\nand a strategic agenda emphasizing the role of LRMs in improving reasoning\nproficiency and domain flexibility. As the first survey of its scope, this work\nconsolidates recent PoLM advancements and establishes a rigorous intellectual\nframework for future research, fostering the development of LLMs that excel in\nprecision, ethical robustness, and versatility across scientific and societal\napplications.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid advancement and deployment of intelligent agents and\nartificial general intelligence (AGI), a fundamental challenge for future\nnetworks is enabling efficient communications among agents. Unlike traditional\nhuman-centric, data-driven communication networks, the primary goal of\nagent-based communication is to facilitate coordination among agents.\nTherefore, task comprehension and collaboration become the key objectives of\ncommunications, rather than data synchronization. Semantic communication\n(SemCom) aims to align information and knowledge among agents to expedite task\ncomprehension. While significant research has been conducted on SemCom for\ntwo-agent systems, the development of semantic communication networks\n(SemComNet) for multi-agent systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper,\nwe provide a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of SemComNet, focusing on\ntheir fundamentals, security, and privacy aspects. We introduce a novel\nthree-layer architecture for multi-agent interaction, comprising the control\nlayer, semantic transmission layer, and cognitive sensing layer. We explore\nworking modes and enabling technologies, and present a taxonomy of security and\nprivacy threats, along with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. Finally, we\noutline future research directions, paving the way toward intelligent, robust,\nand energy-efficient SemComNet. This survey represents the first comprehensive\nanalysis of SemComNet, offering detailed insights into its core principles as\nwell as associated security and privacy challenges.",

However, watch time\nprediction suffers from duration bias, hindering its ability to reflect users'\ninterests accurately. Existing label-correction approaches attempt to uncover\nuser interests through grouping and normalizing observed watch time according\nto video duration. Although effective to some extent, we found that these\napproaches regard completely played records (i.e., a user watches the entire\nvideo) as equally high interest, which deviates from what we observed on real\ndatasets: users have varied explicit feedback proportion when completely\nplaying videos. In this paper, we introduce the counterfactual watch time(CWT),\nthe potential watch time a user would spend on the video if its duration is\nsufficiently long. Analysis shows that the duration bias is caused by the\ntruncation of CWT due to the video duration limitation, which usually occurs on\nthose completely played records. Besides, a Counterfactual Watch Model (CWM) is\nproposed, revealing that CWT equals the time users get the maximum benefit from\nvideo recommender systems. Moreover, a cost-based transform function is defined\nto transform the CWT into the estimation of user interest, and the model can be\nlearned by optimizing a counterfactual likelihood function defined over\nobserved user watch times. Extensive experiments on three real video\nrecommendation datasets and online A/B testing demonstrated that CWM\neffectively enhanced video recommendation accuracy and counteracted the\nduration bias.",

Focusing on the TikTok short-format video platform as a case\nstudy, we employ a novel mixed methodology of combining survey responses with\ndata donations of behavioral traces. We survey 1590 TikTok users and stratify\nthem into three addiction groups (i.e., less/moderately/highly likely\naddicted). Then, we obtain data donations from 107 surveyed participants. By\nanalyzing users' data we find that, among others, highly likely addicted users\nspend more time watching TikTok videos and keep coming back to TikTok\nthroughout the day, indicating a compulsion to use the platform. Finally, by\nusing basic user engagement features, we train classifier models to identify\nhighly likely addicted users with $F_1 \\geq 0.55$.

Our approach\nleverages this proxy reward function in an RL framework. Specifically, users\nspecify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the LLM\nevaluates an RL agent's behavior against the desired behavior described by the\nprompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The RL agent then uses this\nreward to update its behavior. We evaluate whether our approach can train\nagents aligned with user objectives in the Ultimatum Game, matrix games, and\nthe DealOrNoDeal negotiation task.

To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied\napproach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to\nan optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

While human-in-the-loop (HIL) methods can help, they\nmay exacerbate the problem, as humans are prone to biases that lead to\ninconsistent, subjective, or misaligned feedback, complicating the learning\nprocess. To address these issues, we propose two key contributions. First, we\nextend the use of zero-shot, off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for\nreward shaping beyond natural language processing (NLP) to continuous control\ntasks. By leveraging LLMs as direct feedback providers, we replace surrogate\nmodels trained on human feedback, which often suffer from the bias inherent in\nthe feedback data it is trained on. Second, we introduce a hybrid framework\n(LLM-HFBF) that enables LLMs to identify and correct biases in human feedback\nwhile incorporating this feedback into the reward shaping process. The LLM-HFBF\nframework creates a more balanced and reliable system by addressing both the\nlimitations of LLMs (e.g., lack of domain-specific knowledge) and human\nsupervision (e.g., inherent biases). By enabling human feedback bias flagging\nand correction, our approach improves reinforcement learning performance and\nreduces reliance on potentially biased human guidance. Empirical experiments\nshow that biased human feedback significantly reduces performance, with average\nepisodic reward (AER) dropping from 28.472 in (unbiased approaches) to 7.039\n(biased with conservative bias). In contrast, LLM-based approaches maintain a\nmatching AER like unbiased feedback, even in custom edge case scenarios.",

Adding a query that emphasizes specific LLM architectures (e.g., BERT, T5) used in ranking could also enhance technical specificity.

            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong promise as rerankers,\nespecially in ``listwise'' settings where an LLM is prompted to rerank several\nsearch results at once. However, this ``cascading'' retrieve-and-rerank\napproach is limited by the bounded recall problem: relevant documents not\nretrieved initially are permanently excluded from the final ranking. Adaptive\nretrieval techniques address this problem, but do not work with listwise\nrerankers because they assume a document's score is computed independently from\nother documents. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of an existing\nadaptive retrieval method that supports the listwise setting and helps guide\nthe retrieval process itself (thereby overcoming the bounded recall problem for\nLLM rerankers). Specifically, our proposed algorithm merges results both from\nthe initial ranking and feedback documents provided by the most relevant\ndocuments seen up to that point. Through extensive experiments across diverse\nLLM rerankers, first stage retrievers, and feedback sources, we demonstrate\nthat our method can improve nDCG@10 by up to 13.23% and recall by 28.02%--all\nwhile keeping the total number of LLM inferences constant and overheads due to\nthe adaptive process minimal. The work opens the door to leveraging LLM-based\nsearch in settings where the initial pool of results is limited, e.g., by\nlegacy systems, or by the cost of deploying a semantic first-stage.",

A feature adaptation step is further introduced to\nalign the semantics of user/item representations with the LLM.

This paper conducts an in-depth\nexamination of how integrating LLMs with search engines can mutually benefit\nboth technologies. We focus on two main areas: using search engines to improve\nLLMs (Search4LLM) and enhancing search engine functions using LLMs\n(LLM4Search). For Search4LLM, we investigate how search engines can provide\ndiverse high-quality datasets for pre-training of LLMs, how they can use the\nmost relevant documents to help LLMs learn to answer queries more accurately,\nhow training LLMs with Learning-To-Rank (LTR) tasks can enhance their ability\nto respond with greater precision, and how incorporating recent search results\ncan make LLM-generated content more accurate and current. In terms of\nLLM4Search, we examine how LLMs can be used to summarize content for better\nindexing by search engines, improve query outcomes through optimization,\nenhance the ranking of search results by analyzing document relevance, and help\nin annotating data for learning-to-rank tasks in various learning contexts.\nHowever, this promising integration comes with its challenges, which include\naddressing potential biases and ethical issues in training models, managing the\ncomputational and other costs of incorporating LLMs into search services, and\ncontinuously updating LLM training with the ever-changing web content.

The impact of this surge in AIGC on IR systems\nremains an open question, with the primary challenge being the lack of a\ndedicated benchmark for researchers. In this paper, we introduce Cocktail, a\ncomprehensive benchmark tailored for evaluating IR models in this mixed-sourced\ndata landscape of the LLM era. Cocktail consists of 16 diverse datasets with\nmixed human-written and LLM-generated corpora across various text retrieval\ntasks and domains. Additionally, to avoid the potential bias from previously\nincluded dataset information in LLMs, we also introduce an up-to-date dataset,\nnamed NQ-UTD, with queries derived from recent events. Through conducting over\n1,000 experiments to assess state-of-the-art retrieval models against the\nbenchmarked datasets in Cocktail, we uncover a clear trade-off between ranking\nperformance and source bias in neural retrieval models, highlighting the\nnecessity for a balanced approach in designing future IR systems.

In this paper, we\nexplore an alternative approach: LLM-generated usefulness labels, which\nincorporate both implicit and explicit user behavior signals to evaluate\ndocument usefulness. We propose Task-aware Rubric-based Usefulness Evaluation\n(TRUE), a rubric-driven evaluation method that employs iterative sampling and\nreasoning to model complex search behavior patterns. Our findings show that (i)\nLLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by leveraging comprehensive search\nsession history incorporating personalization and contextual understanding, and\n(ii) fine-tuned LLMs improve usefulness judgments when provided with structured\nsearch session contexts. Additionally, we examine whether LLMs can distinguish\nbetween relevance and usefulness, particularly in cases where this divergence\nimpacts search success. We also conduct an ablation study to identify key\nmetrics for accurate usefulness label generation, optimizing for token\nefficiency and cost-effectiveness in real-world applications.

This paper conducts an in-depth\nexamination of how integrating LLMs with search engines can mutually benefit\nboth technologies. We focus on two main areas: using search engines to improve\nLLMs (Search4LLM) and enhancing search engine functions using LLMs\n(LLM4Search). For Search4LLM, we investigate how search engines can provide\ndiverse high-quality datasets for pre-training of LLMs, how they can use the\nmost relevant documents to help LLMs learn to answer queries more accurately,\nhow training LLMs with Learning-To-Rank (LTR) tasks can enhance their ability\nto respond with greater precision, and how incorporating recent search results\ncan make LLM-generated content more accurate and current. In terms of\nLLM4Search, we examine how LLMs can be used to summarize content for better\nindexing by search engines, improve query outcomes through optimization,\nenhance the ranking of search results by analyzing document relevance, and help\nin annotating data for learning-to-rank tasks in various learning contexts.\nHowever, this promising integration comes with its challenges, which include\naddressing potential biases and ethical issues in training models, managing the\ncomputational and other costs of incorporating LLMs into search services, and\ncontinuously updating LLM training with the ever-changing web content. We\ndiscuss these challenges and chart out required research directions to address\nthem. We also discuss broader implications for service computing, such as\nscalability, privacy concerns, and the need to adapt search engine\narchitectures for these advanced models.",

Our second taxonomy of datasets for bias\nevaluation categorizes datasets by their structure as counterfactual inputs or\nprompts, and identifies the targeted harms and social groups; we also release a\nconsolidation of publicly-available datasets for improved access.

However, while existing surveys predominantly focus on ML and DL\ntechniques or limited modalities (text or images), a gap remains in addressing\nthe latest advancements and multi-modal applications of LLM-based methods. This\nsurvey fills that gap by exploring recent literature utilizing multimodal LLMs\nto augment image, text, and audio data, offering a comprehensive understanding\nof these processes. We outlined various methods employed in the LLM-based\nimage, text and speech augmentation, and discussed the limitations identified\nin current approaches. Additionally, we identified potential solutions to these\nlimitations from the literature to enhance the efficacy of data augmentation\npractices using multimodal LLMs. This survey serves as a foundation for future\nresearch, aiming to refine and expand the use of multimodal LLMs in enhancing\ndataset quality and diversity for deep learning applications.

The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the\nnumber of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been\nlinked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved.\nThese emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context\nlearning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific\ndebate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors,\nsuch as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What\nunderlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential,\nemergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about\ntheir definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we\nshed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the\nphenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world\nconsequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing\ninconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the\nconditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling\nlaws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting\nstrategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and\ninference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection. However,\nemergence is not inherently positive. As AI systems gain autonomous reasoning\ncapabilities, they also develop harmful behaviors, including deception,\nmanipulation, and reward hacking. We highlight growing concerns about safety\nand governance, emphasizing the need for better evaluation frameworks and\nregulatory oversight.",

This skepticism arises from two\nobservations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high performance on emergent\nabilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous metrics used to measure\nthese abilities. In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the\nlens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We\ndemonstrate that the Transformer models with the same pre-training loss, but\ndifferent model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various\ndownstream tasks, with a fixed data corpus, tokenization, and model\narchitecture. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on\ncertain tasks -- regardless of the continuity of metrics -- when its\npre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this\nthreshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This\ninspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models\nwith lower pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be\npredicted by merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher\npre-training losses.",

The primary direction of evolution is to exploit\nthe much wider gamut of visual and textual cues to achieve alignment.\nConcretely, those methods with impressive performance often design a heavy\nfusion block for sentence (words)-video (frames) interaction, regardless of the\nprohibitive computation complexity. Nevertheless, these approaches are not\noptimal in terms of feature utilization and retrieval efficiency. To address\nthis issue, we adopt multi-granularity visual feature learning, ensuring the\nmodel's comprehensiveness in capturing visual content features spanning from\nabstract to detailed levels during the training phase. To better leverage the\nmulti-granularity features, we devise a two-stage retrieval architecture in the\nretrieval phase. This solution ingeniously balances the coarse and fine\ngranularity of retrieval content. Moreover, it also strikes a harmonious\nequilibrium between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, in\ntraining phase, we design a parameter-free text-gated interaction block (TIB)\nfor fine-grained video representation learning and embed an extra Pearson\nConstraint to optimize cross-modal representation learning. In retrieval phase,\nwe use coarse-grained video representations for fast recall of top-k\ncandidates, which are then reranked by fine-grained video representations.\nExtensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness.

Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to\nproduce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with advancements in VLMs,\nefforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain\nand to introduce descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM\ntraining. This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM\nspecifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE\nmodels, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel\nInstruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as\nexpert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts\ntailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects\nof the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on\na specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy\nof the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by\nfacilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a\ntwo-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance\ndegradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset\nusing our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap\ndataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no\nadditional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant\ncaptions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B\nVLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design.

In response to task interference, our MoME specializes in both\nvision and language modality to adapt to task discrepancies. Extensive\nexperiments show that MoME significantly improves the performance of generalist\nMLLMs across various VL tasks. The source code is released at\nhttps://github.com/JiuTian-VL/MoME",

The prowess of LLMs is underpinned by their substantial model size,\nextensive and diverse datasets, and the vast computational power harnessed\nduring training, all of which contribute to the emergent abilities of LLMs\n(e.g., in-context learning) that are not present in small models. Within this\ncontext, the mixture of experts (MoE) has emerged as an effective method for\nsubstantially scaling up model capacity with minimal computation overhead,\ngaining significant attention from academia and industry. Despite its growing\nprevalence, there lacks a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature\non MoE. This survey seeks to bridge that gap, serving as an essential resource\nfor researchers delving into the intricacies of MoE. We first briefly introduce\nthe structure of the MoE layer, followed by proposing a new taxonomy of MoE.\nNext, we overview the core designs for various MoE models including both\nalgorithmic and systemic aspects, alongside collections of available\nopen-source implementations, hyperparameter configurations and empirical\nevaluations. Furthermore, we delineate the multifaceted applications of MoE in\npractice, and outline some potential directions for future research.

These large models, leveraging their extensive\ntraining data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream\ntasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the\ndevelopment of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous\nconsumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the\ndifficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the\nusability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted\nmuch attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and\nactivating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been\nshown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with\nfewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal\ndata. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various\ndomains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements\nof MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their\nlimitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas,\nand we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic\ndesign of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms,\ntraining strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of\nMoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning,\nmeta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally,\nwe summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its\napplications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we\ndiscuss promising future research directions.",

However, storing all experts on GPUs incurs\nsignificant memory overhead, increasing the monetary cost of MoE-based\ninference. To address this, we propose eMoE, a memory efficient inference\nsystem for MoE-based large language models (LLMs) by leveraging our\nobservations from experiment measurements. eMoE reduces memory usage by\npredicting and loading only the required experts based on recurrent patterns in\nexpert routing. To reduce loading latency while maintaining accuracy, as we\nfound using the same experts for subsequent prompts has minimal impact on\nperplexity, eMoE invokes the expert predictor every few prompts rather than for\neach prompt. In addition, it skips predictions for tasks less sensitive to\nrouting accuracy. Finally, it has task-aware scheduling to minimize inference\nlatency by considering Service Level Objectives (SLOs), task-specific output\nlengths, and expert loading latencies. Experimental results show that compared\nto existing systems, eMoE reduces memory consumption by up to 80% while\nmaintaining accuracy and reduces inference latency by up to 17%. It also\nenables processing prompts 40x longer, batches 4.5x larger, and achieves 1.5x\nhigher throughput.",

            "abstract": "The success of the transformer architecture in natural language processing\nhas recently triggered attention in the computer vision field. The transformer\nhas been used as a replacement for the widely used convolution operators, due\nto its ability to learn long-range dependencies. This replacement was proven to\nbe successful in numerous tasks, in which several state-of-the-art methods rely\non transformers for better learning. In computer vision, the 3D field has also\nwitnessed an increase in employing the transformer for 3D convolution neural\nnetworks and multi-layer perceptron networks. Although a number of surveys have\nfocused on transformers in vision in general, 3D vision requires special\nattention due to the difference in data representation and processing when\ncompared to 2D vision. In this work, we present a systematic and thorough\nreview of more than 100 transformers methods for different 3D vision tasks,\nincluding classification, segmentation, detection, completion, pose estimation,\nand others. We discuss transformer design in 3D vision, which allows it to\nprocess data with various 3D representations. For each application, we\nhighlight key properties and contributions of proposed transformer-based\nmethods. To assess the competitiveness of these methods, we compare their\nperformance to common non-transformer methods on 12 3D benchmarks. We conclude\nthe survey by discussing different open directions and challenges for\ntransformers in 3D vision.

In human evaluations against SDXL, GenTron achieves a 51.1% win\nrate in visual quality (with a 19.8% draw rate), and a 42.3% win rate in text\nalignment (with a 42.9% draw rate).

This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to\naddress this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in\npretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D\nwindows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA\neliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise\nsliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel\nhardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being\nhardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the\nfirst efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving\n58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over\nFlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading\nvideo DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s\nwithout quality degradation, requiring no training.

In this work, we present a systematic and thorough\nreview of more than 100 transformers methods for different 3D vision tasks,\nincluding classification, segmentation, detection, completion, pose estimation,\nand others. We discuss transformer design in 3D vision, which allows it to\nprocess data with various 3D representations.

Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational\nresources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion\ndynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic,\nand temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel\nframework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for\nlong video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range\ntemporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model.\nSpecifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of\nthe DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and\nbalancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive\nnorm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual\nunits from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during\nvideo generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced\nfrom the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent\ntokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on\neight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in\ndynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on\nthe remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process.

The key is to map point-based 3D data into discrete tokens with\ndifferent levels of detail, naturally establishing a sequential relationship\nbetween different levels suitable for autoregressive modeling. Additionally,\nthe cross-scale querying transformer connects tokens globally across different\nlevels of detail without requiring an ordered sequence. Benefiting from this\napproach, G3PT features a versatile 3D generation pipeline that effortlessly\nsupports diverse conditional structures, enabling the generation of 3D shapes\nfrom various types of conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that G3PT\nachieves superior generation quality and generalization ability compared to\nprevious 3D generation methods.

            "abstract": "Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language\ngeneration, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended\ntemporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is\ncomputationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language\ntokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range\ndependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution\nshort-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an\nunlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer\ntokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a\nmanageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time\nand memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to\nsupport the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on\nlong video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet\neffective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.

To address this, we\nintroduce Lumina-Video, a framework that leverages the strengths of Next-DiT\nwhile introducing tailored solutions for video synthesis.

By incorporating\nthe motion score as an explicit condition, Lumina-Video also enables direct\ncontrol of generated videos' dynamic degree. Combined with a progressive\ntraining scheme with increasingly higher resolution and FPS, and a multi-source\ntraining scheme with mixed natural and synthetic data, Lumina-Video achieves\nremarkable aesthetic quality and motion smoothness at high training and\ninference efficiency.

In this work, we\nintroduce Direct3D, a native 3D generative model scalable to in-the-wild input\nimages, without requiring a multiview diffusion model or SDS optimization. Our\napproach comprises two primary components: a Direct 3D Variational Auto-Encoder\n(D3D-VAE) and a Direct 3D Diffusion Transformer (D3D-DiT). D3D-VAE efficiently\nencodes high-resolution 3D shapes into a compact and continuous latent triplane\nspace. Notably, our method directly supervises the decoded geometry using a\nsemi-continuous surface sampling strategy, diverging from previous methods\nrelying on rendered images as supervision signals. D3D-DiT models the\ndistribution of encoded 3D latents and is specifically designed to fuse\npositional information from the three feature maps of the triplane latent,\nenabling a native 3D generative model scalable to large-scale 3D datasets.\nAdditionally, we introduce an innovative image-to-3D generation pipeline\nincorporating semantic and pixel-level image conditions, allowing the model to\nproduce 3D shapes consistent with the provided conditional image input.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our large-scale\npre-trained Direct3D over previous image-to-3D approaches, achieving\nsignificantly better generation quality and generalization ability, thus\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art for 3D content creation.

In this work, we extend this line of inquiry by\ninvestigating the impact on confidence estimation. We evaluate three\nrepresentative self-improvement paradigms-basic prompting, Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting, and tuning-based methods and find that iterative\nself-improvement can lead to systematic overconfidence, as evidenced by a\nsteadily increasing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and lower accuracy with\nhigh confidence. We then further explore the integration of confidence\ncalibration techniques with self-improvement. Specifically, we compare three\nstrategies: (1) applying calibration after multiple rounds of self-improvement,\n(2) calibrating before self-improvement, and (3) applying calibration\niteratively at each self-improvement step. Our results show that iterative\ncalibration is most effective in reducing ECE, yielding improved calibration.\nOur work pioneers the study of self-improving LLMs from a calibration\nperspective, offering valuable insights into balancing model performance and\nreliability.",

One\npromising solution to improve the LLMs' performance is to ask LLMs to revise\ntheir answer after generation, a technique known as self-correction. Among the\ntwo types of self-correction, intrinsic self-correction is considered a\npromising direction because it does not utilize external knowledge. However,\nrecent works doubt the validity of LLM's ability to conduct intrinsic\nself-correction. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on the intrinsic\nself-correction capabilities of LLMs through theoretical analyses and empirical\nexperiments. In addition, we identify two critical factors for successful\nself-correction: zero temperature and fair prompts. Leveraging these factors,\nwe demonstrate that intrinsic self-correction ability is exhibited across\nmultiple existing LLMs. Our findings offer insights into the fundamental\ntheories underlying the self-correction behavior of LLMs and remark on the\nimportance of unbiased prompts and zero temperature settings in harnessing\ntheir full potential.",

This capability is especially valuable in\nengineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended\noperational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems.\nBy mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and\nconstraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach\nsystematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic\nfluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also\nexplore the models capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop\nbased on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset\ncomprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation\npoints. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task\ncomplexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data\ncreation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set\nof LLMs including Llama3, Gemma, Mixtral, Mistral, and Qwen. Results reveal\nthat while models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code, they\nfrequently exhibit logical errors in translating expert knowledge. Furthermore,\niterative self-correction yields only marginal improvements (up to 3%).\nOverall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the\nselection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly\ndelineating the types of errors encountered. The complete implementation, along\nwith all relevant data, is available at GitHub.",

Previous studies have mainly concentrated on\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs,\nparticularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely\nunexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs\nduring both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction\nLearning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated\nself-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without\nrelying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we\ncollect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial\nand refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs\nduring the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs\nstruggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without\nadditional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their\nperformance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when\ntheir self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and\ndisfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a\nrefinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models\nthrough additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses\ndirectly without further refinement.",

In this paper, we investigate a fundamental question: is moral\nself-correction an innate capability in LLMs? To explore this, we conduct (1) a\nmechanistic analysis of how key components of self-correction, such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and external feedback, interact to enable\nmoral self-correction; and (2) a behavioral analysis of LLMs' ability to\ndistinguish between desired and undesired outputs, introducing a\nself-distinguish framework. Our mechanistic analysis reveals that LLMs struggle\nto effectively leverage helpful feedback, and conflicts can arise between\nfeedback and CoT reasoning. These limitations suggest that LLMs fail to\nidentify useful contextual information, instead prioritizing their own internal\nknowledge. Additionally, our behavioral analysis indicates that LLMs struggle\nto differentiate among their own outputs.

Nevertheless,\nlittle is known about how such capabilities arise. In this work, based on a\nsimplified setup akin to an alignment task, we theoretically analyze\nself-correction from an in-context learning perspective, showing that when LLMs\ngive relatively accurate self-examinations as rewards, they are capable of\nrefining responses in an in-context way. Notably, going beyond previous\ntheories on over-simplified linear transformers, our theoretical construction\nunderpins the roles of several key designs of realistic transformers for\nself-correction: softmax attention, multi-head attention, and the MLP block. We\nvalidate these findings extensively on synthetic datasets. Inspired by these\nfindings, we also illustrate novel applications of self-correction, such as\ndefending against LLM jailbreaks, where a simple self-correction step does make\na large difference.

            "abstract": "Previous studies proposed that the reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs) can be improved through self-reflection, i.e., letting LLMs\nreflect on their own output to identify and correct mistakes in the initial\nresponses. However, earlier experiments offer mixed results when it comes to\nthe benefits of self-reflection. Furthermore, prior studies on self-reflection\nare predominantly concerned with the reasoning capabilities of models, ignoring\nthe potential for self-reflection in safety, bias, and ideological leaning.\nHere, by conducting a series of experiments testing LLM's self-reflection\ncapability in various tasks using a variety of prompts and different LLMs, we\nmake several contributions to the literature. First, we reconcile conflicting\nfindings regarding the benefit of self-reflection, by demonstrating that the\noutcome of self-reflection is sensitive to prompt wording -- both the original\nprompt that are used to elicit an initial answer and the subsequent prompt used\nto self-reflect. Specifically, although self-reflection may improve the\nreasoning capability of LLMs when the initial response is simple, the technique\ncannot improve upon the state-of-the-art chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.\nSecond, we show that self-reflection can lead to safer (75.8\\% reduction in\ntoxic responses while preserving 97.8\\% non-toxic ones), less biased (77\\%\nreduction in gender biased responses, while preserving 94.3\\% unbiased ones),\nand more ideologically neutral responses (100\\% reduction in partisan leaning\nresponse, while preserving 87.7\\% non-partisan ones). The paper concludes by\ndiscussing the implications of our findings on the deployment of large language\nmodels. We release our experiments at\nhttps://github.com/Michael98Liu/self-reflection.",

            "abstract": "While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in visual\nand language reasoning tasks, they invariably generate flawed responses.\nSelf-correction that instructs models to refine their outputs presents a\npromising solution to this issue. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs,\nparticularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely\nunexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs\nduring both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction\nLearning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated\nself-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without\nrelying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we\ncollect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial\nand refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs\nduring the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs\nstruggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without\nadditional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their\nperformance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when\ntheir self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and\ndisfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a\nrefinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models\nthrough additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses\ndirectly without further refinement.",

Among them, academia is not simply a domain\naffected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs.\nIn academic publications, this phenomenon is represented during the\nincorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts.\nWe proposed the concept of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) in our\nprevious paper. As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase\nof ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold\ntransformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they\nalso pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey\npaper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin\nwith a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review\nwhat ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the\nincorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods,\nnew datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for\nASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and\ninvestigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR.\nLastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for\nASPR. We hope this survey can serve as an inspirational reference for the\nresearchers and promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the evaluation of Large Language Models has emerged as a popular\narea of research. The three crucial questions for LLM evaluation are ``what,\nwhere, and how to evaluate''. However, the existing research mainly focuses on\nthe first two questions, which are basically what tasks to give the LLM during\ntesting and what kind of knowledge it should deal with. As for the third\nquestion, which is about what standards to use, the types of evaluators, how to\nscore, and how to rank, there hasn't been much discussion. In this paper, we\nanalyze evaluation methods by comparing various criteria with both manual and\nautomatic evaluation, utilizing onsite, crowd-sourcing, public annotators and\nGPT-4, with different scoring methods and ranking systems. We propose a new\ndataset, LLMEval and conduct evaluations on 20 LLMs. A total of 2,186\nindividuals participated, leading to the generation of 243,337 manual\nannotations and 57,511 automatic evaluation results. We perform comparisons and\nanalyses of different settings and conduct 10 conclusions that can provide some\ninsights for evaluating LLM in the future.

Among them, academia is not simply a domain\naffected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs.\nIn academic publications, this phenomenon is represented during the\nincorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts.\nWe proposed the concept of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) in our\nprevious paper. As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase\nof ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold\ntransformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they\nalso pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey\npaper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin\nwith a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review\nwhat ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the\nincorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods,\nnew datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for\nASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and\ninvestigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR.\nLastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for\nASPR. We hope this survey can serve as an inspirational reference for the\nresearchers and promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.",

This paper explores the zero-shot abilities\nof recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of\nliterature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two\ncomponents: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing\na literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective\nLLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step\nsearch strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the\nabstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying\nan external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking\nmechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized\nrecall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the\nLLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step\napproach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in\nthe plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based\nliterature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a\nprotocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set\ncontamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to\npromote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical\nresults suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature\nreviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and\nplanning.

While there has\nbeen significant work developing these methods, our understanding of the\nbenefits and downsides of each stage in RLHF is still limited. To fill this\ngap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e.\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key\nproperties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD\ngeneralisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which\nthese models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's\nability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases.\nWe perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and\ninstruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM\nuse cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs,\nparticularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger.\nHowever, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a\nvariety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods\nbetween generalisation and diversity. Our results provide guidance on which\nfine-tuning method should be used depending on the application, and show that\nmore research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and\ndiversity.",

With the\nadvancement of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), the ability to\ncode stands out as one important measure to the model's reasoning performance.\nUsually, a two-stage training paradigm is implemented to obtain a Code LLM,\nnamely the pretraining and the fine-tuning. Within the fine-tuning, supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) are often used to improve\nthe model's zero-shot ability. A large number of work has been conducted to\nimprove the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either\nmodifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still\nlack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what\nkind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon\nthe SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand\nthe correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually\ncraft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a\nsynthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic\nfunctions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train\nand test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through\ncomprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions\nare indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic\nfunctions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target\ndomain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3)\nTraining RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the\nSFT phase.",

However,\nLLMs can also answer questions that are unethical or harmful, raising concerns\nabout their applications. To regulate LLMs' responses to such questions, a\ntraining strategy called \\textit{alignment} can help. Yet, alignment can be\nunexpectedly compromised when fine-tuning an LLM for downstream tasks. This\npaper focuses on recovering the alignment lost during fine-tuning.\n  We observe that there are two distinct directions inherent in an aligned LLM:\nthe \\textit{aligned direction} and the \\textit{harmful direction}. An LLM is\ninclined to answer questions in the aligned direction while refusing queries in\nthe harmful direction. Therefore, we propose to recover the harmful direction\nof the fine-tuned model that has been compromised. Specifically, we restore a\nsmall subset of the fine-tuned model's weight parameters from the original\naligned model using gradient descent. We also introduce a rollback mechanism to\navoid aggressive recovery and maintain downstream task performance. Our\nevaluation on 125 fine-tuned LLMs demonstrates that our method can reduce their\nharmful rate (percentage of answering harmful questions) from 33.25\\% to\n1.74\\%, without sacrificing task performance much. In contrast, the existing\nmethods either only reduce the harmful rate to a limited extent or\nsignificantly impact the normal functionality.

A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense\nand Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently\nsolve complex domains.

In this work, we systematically study\nwhy LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios.

We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by\nfine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales.\nOur experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and\nTic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making\nabilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing\ngap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as\n$\\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and\nself-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for\ndecision-making.",

However, despite the widespread use of policy gradient methods to\ntrain large language models for single turn tasks (e.g., question answering),\nvalue-based methods for multi-turn RL in an off-policy or offline setting have\nproven particularly challenging to scale to the setting of large language\nmodels. This setting requires effectively leveraging pretraining, scaling to\nlarge architectures with billions of parameters, and training on large\ndatasets, all of which represent major challenges for current value-based RL\nmethods. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses\nthese drawbacks, casting Q-learning as a modified supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nproblem where the probabilities of tokens directly translate to Q-values. In\nthis way we obtain an algorithm that smoothly transitions from maximizing the\nlikelihood of the data during pretraining to learning a near-optimal Q-function\nduring finetuning. Our algorithm has strong theoretical foundations, enjoying\nperformance bounds similar to state-of-the-art Q-learning methods, while in\npractice utilizing an objective that closely resembles SFT. Because of this,\nour approach can enjoy the full benefits of the pretraining of language models,\nwithout the need to reinitialize any weights before RL finetuning, and without\nthe need to initialize new heads for predicting values or advantages.\nEmpirically, we evaluate our method on both pretrained LLMs and VLMs, on a\nvariety of tasks including both natural language dialogue and robotic\nmanipulation and navigation from images.",

This paper presents two different\nalgorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised\nmachine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between\nevents. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an\nannotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of \"one type of temporal\nrelation per discourse, it extracts useful information from a cluster of\ntopically related documents. We show that by combining the global information\nof such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping\ncross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between\nevents. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the\naccuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous\nsuccessful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction\nis based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used\ndifferent techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear\nprogramming for temporal inconsistency removal. We think that the experimental\nresults of our EM based algorithm, as a first step toward a fully unsupervised\ntemporal relation extraction method, is encouraging.",

In this study, we revisit this\ndefinition of Event Extraction (EE) by introducing two key argument types that\ncannot be modeled by existing EE frameworks. First, implicit arguments are\nevent arguments which are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but can be\ninferred through context. Second, scattered arguments are event arguments that\nare composed of information scattered throughout the text. These two argument\ntypes are crucial to elicit the full breadth of information required for proper\nevent modeling.\n  To support the extraction of explicit, implicit, and scattered arguments, we\ndevelop a novel dataset, DiscourseEE, which includes 7,464 argument annotations\nfrom online health discourse. Notably, 51.2% of the arguments are implicit, and\n17.4% are scattered, making DiscourseEE a unique corpus for complex event\nextraction. Additionally, we formulate argument extraction as a text generation\nproblem to facilitate the extraction of complex argument types. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and highlight critical open\nchallenges in generative event extraction.

In this paper, we propose GenBEE, an event structure-aware generative\nmodel that captures complex event structures in biomedical text for biomedical\nevent extraction. GenBEE constructs event prompts that distill knowledge from\nLLMs to incorporate both label semantics and argument dependency relationships.\nIn addition, GenBEE generates prefixes with event structural prompts to\nincorporate structural features to improve the model's overall performance. We\nhave evaluated the proposed GenBEE model on three widely used BEE benchmark\ndatasets, namely MLEE, GE11, and PHEE.

Our research shows\nthat trigger effectiveness varies based on the extraction task's\ncharacteristics and data quality, with basic, automatically-generated triggers\nserving as a viable alternative to human-annotated ones. Furthermore, providing\ndetailed event descriptions to the extraction model helps maintain robust\nperformance even when trigger quality degrades.

We\ndemonstrate the significant influence of these pitfalls through comprehensive\nmeta-analyses of recent papers and empirical experiments. To avoid these\npitfalls, we suggest a series of remedies, including specifying data\npreprocessing, standardizing outputs, and providing pipeline evaluation\nresults.

However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their\nability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining\nsemantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we\nprovide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what\nthe pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in\naccordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take\ninspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy\n\"graph tracing\" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts\nseen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the\ngraph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given\nexemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze\nintermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of\ncontext is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic\nrepresentations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure.\nFurther, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their\nsemantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure\nis still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the\npretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy\nminimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an\nimplicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall,\nour findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model\nrepresentations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.",

A key task within IE is\nRelation Extraction (RE), which identifies relationships between entities in\ntext. Various RE methods exist, including supervised, unsupervised, weakly\nsupervised, and rule-based approaches. Recent studies leveraging pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) have shown significant success in this area. In the\ncurrent era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tuning these models\ncan overcome limitations associated with zero-shot LLM prompting-based RE\nmethods, especially regarding domain adaptation challenges and identifying\nimplicit relations between entities in sentences. These implicit relations,\nwhich cannot be easily extracted from a sentence's dependency tree, require\nlogical inference for accurate identification. This work explores the\nperformance of fine-tuned LLMs and their integration into the Retrieval\nAugmented-based (RAG) RE approach to address the challenges of identifying\nimplicit relations at the sentence level, particularly when LLMs act as\ngenerators within the RAG framework. Empirical evaluations on the TACRED,\nTACRED-Revisited (TACREV), Re-TACRED, and SemEVAL datasets show significant\nperformance improvements with fine-tuned LLMs, including Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B,\nand T5 (Large). Notably, our approach achieves substantial gains on SemEVAL,\nwhere implicit relations are common, surpassing previous results on this\ndataset.

In parallel, several\nworks in systems research have focussed on developing (parameter) efficient\nfine-tuning methods (e.g., LoRA), but few works, if any, investigated whether\nsuch efficient methods enhance or diminish privacy risks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this gap and arrive at a surprising conclusion: efficient\nfine-tuning methods like LoRA mitigate privacy risks similar to private\nfine-tuning methods like DP. Our empirical finding directly contradicts\nprevailing wisdom that privacy and efficiency objectives are at odds during\nfine-tuning. Our finding is established by (a) carefully defining measures of\nprivacy and utility that distinguish between memorizing sensitive and\nnon-sensitive tokens in training and test datasets used in fine-tuning and (b)\nextensive evaluations using multiple open-source language models from Pythia,\nGemma, and Llama families and different domain-specific datasets.",

We introduce Learning2Rewrite, a novel\nframework for detecting AI-generated text with exceptional generalization to\nunseen domains. Our method leverages the insight that LLMs inherently modify\nAI-generated content less than human-written text when tasked with rewriting.\nBy training LLMs to minimize alterations on AI-generated inputs, we amplify\nthis disparity, yielding a more distinguishable and generalizable edit distance\nacross diverse text distributions. Extensive experiments on data from 21\nindependent domains and four major LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama-3)\ndemonstrate that our detector outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods by\nup to 23.04% in AUROC for in-distribution tests, 37.26% for out-of-distribution\ntests, and 48.66% under adversarial attacks. Our unique training objective\nensures better generalizability compared to directly training for\nclassification, when leveraging the same amount of parameters. Our findings\nsuggest that reinforcing LLMs' inherent rewriting tendencies offers a robust\nand scalable solution for detecting AI-generated text.",

While detecting\nLLM-generated content is crucial for mitigating these risks, current methods\noften focus on binary classification, failing to address the complexities of\nreal-world scenarios like human-LLM collaboration. To move beyond binary\nclassification and address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm for\ndetecting LLM-generated content. This approach introduces two novel tasks: LLM\nRole Recognition (LLM-RR), a multi-class classification task that identifies\nspecific roles of LLM in content generation, and LLM Influence Measurement\n(LLM-IM), a regression task that quantifies the extent of LLM involvement in\ncontent creation. To support these tasks, we propose LLMDetect, a benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate detectors' performance on these new tasks. LLMDetect\nincludes the Hybrid News Detection Corpus (HNDC) for training detectors, as\nwell as DetectEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite that considers five\ndistinct cross-context variations and two multi-intensity variations within the\nsame LLM role. This allows for a thorough assessment of detectors'\ngeneralization and robustness across diverse contexts. Our empirical validation\nof 10 baseline detection methods demonstrates that fine-tuned PLM-based models\nconsistently outperform others on both tasks, while advanced LLMs face\nchallenges in accurately detecting their own generated content. Our\nexperimental results and analysis offer insights for developing more effective\ndetection models for LLM-generated content.

Experimental results across\nmultiple LLMs and state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nachieves comparable perplexity to industry-leading systems, including Google's\nSynthID-Text, yet enhances watermark robustness against paraphrasing and\nlexical perturbation attacks while introducing minimal performance overhead.\nOur approach avoids reliance on additional mechanisms beyond standard text\ngeneration pipelines, facilitating straightforward adoption, suggesting a\npractical path toward globally consistent watermarking of AI-generated content.",

However, the security against spoofing\nattacks remains relatively understudied. For example, a piggyback attack can\nmaliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate\nspeech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation\nof the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending\nagainst spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to\nsemantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and\n(2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the\nlocal, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that post-hoc\nembeds watermarks into a given target text while preserving its original\nmeaning. Our method introduces a semantic mapping model, which guides the\ngeneration of a green-red token list, contrastively trained to be sensitive to\nsemantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving changes.\nExperiments on two standard benchmarks demonstrate strong robustness against\nremoval attacks and security against spoofing attacks, including sentiment\nreversal and toxic content insertion, while maintaining high watermark\ndetectability.

This survey provides a\ncomprehensive review of emerging techniques enhancing reasoning in LLMs. We\ncategorize existing methods into key approaches, including prompting strategies\n(e.g., Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Self-Consistency, and Tree-of-Thought\nreasoning), architectural innovations (e.g., retrieval-augmented models,\nmodular reasoning networks, and neuro-symbolic integration), and learning\nparadigms (e.g., fine-tuning with reasoning-specific datasets, reinforcement\nlearning, and self-supervised reasoning objectives). Additionally, we explore\nevaluation frameworks used to assess reasoning in LLMs and highlight open\nchallenges, such as hallucinations, robustness, and reasoning generalization\nacross diverse tasks.

In this work, we first control the diversity of both\nsides according to the number of samples for fine-tuning, which can directly\nreflect their influence.

However, CE maximizes the likelihood of observed data without\naccounting for alternative possibilities. As such, CE usually leads to reduced\ndiversity in the model's outputs, which hinders further development that\nrequires sampling to explore better responses. To address this limitation, this\npaper introduces a new game-theoretic formulation for SFT. In this framework,\nan auxiliary variable is introduced to regulate the learning process. We prove\nthat the proposed game-theoretic approach connects to the problem of reverse KL\nminimization with entropy regularization. This regularization prevents\nover-memorization of training data and promotes output diversity. To implement\nthis framework, we develop GEM, a new training algorithm that is\ncomputationally efficient as CE by leveraging some unique properties of LLMs.\nEmpirical studies of pre-trained models from 3B to 70B parameters show that GEM\nachieves comparable downstream performance to CE while significantly enhancing\noutput diversity. This increased diversity translates to performance gains in\ntest-time compute scaling for chat and code generation tasks. Moreover, we\nobserve that preserving output diversity has the added benefit of mitigating\nforgetting, as maintaining diverse outputs encourages models to retain\npre-trained knowledge throughout the training process.",

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a noise-robust SFT\nframework to enhance model capabilities in downstream tasks. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a robust SFT framework (RobustFT) that performs noise\ndetection and relabeling on downstream task data.

In the denoising phase, we utilize\na context-enhanced strategy, which incorporates the most relevant and confident\nknowledge followed by careful assessment to generate reliable annotations.\nAdditionally, we introduce an effective data selection mechanism based on\nresponse entropy, ensuring only high-quality samples are retained for\nfine-tuning.

To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment\nmethods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training\nof LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs\nare not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we\ntake a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to\nperform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input\nunderstanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs'\nparameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it\nsuperior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is\nmodel-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned\nChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and\n10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models\naligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when\ncombining BPO with PPO or DPO.

While\nthese paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often\ninvolve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning.\nTo systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new\nmultimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a\nsix-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite\nand verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual\nreasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same\ndata source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing\nSFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn\nreasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid\nreasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module\nintegrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more\ngenuine, adaptive reasoning behavior. Notably, our model VLAA-Thinker, based on\nQwen2.5VL 3B, achieves top-1 performance on Open LMM Reasoning Leaderboard\n(https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/Open_LMM_Reasoning_Leaderboard)\namong 4B scale LVLMs, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.8%. We hope\nour findings provide valuable insights in developing reasoning-capable LVLMs\nand can inform future research in this area.",

This position paper argues that LRMs\nsubstantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT\nparadigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires\ncontextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify\nthree foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve\nambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over\ncross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural\nintentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent,\naudience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can\nperform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential\nerrors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better\nrobustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various\nscenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level\ntranslation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that\ndemonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several\ninteresting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as\nwell as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and\ninference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation\nsystems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents\ncapable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds\nus to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios\nin a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.",

The method performs\ncompetitively with recent supervised and unsupervised approaches for\ncommonsense reasoning, even when applied to other languages in a zero-shot\nmanner.

We benchmark metric\nperformance, assess their incremental performance over successive campaigns,\nand measure their sensitivity to a range of linguistic phenomena. We also\ninvestigate claims that Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective as MT\nevaluators by evaluating on ACES. Our results demonstrate that different metric\nfamilies struggle with different phenomena and that LLM-based methods fail to\ndemonstrate reliable performance. Our analyses indicate that most metrics\nignore the source sentence, tend to prefer surface-level overlap and end up\nincorporating properties of base models which are not always beneficial.

In this work, we find that machine-translated text from a\nsingle high-quality source language can contribute significantly to the\npretraining of multilingual LLMs. We translate FineWeb-Edu, a high-quality\nEnglish web dataset, into French, German, and Spanish, resulting in a final\n300B-token dataset, which we call TransWeb-Edu, and pretrain a 1.3B-parameter\nmodel, CuatroLLM, from scratch on this dataset. Across five non-English\nreasoning tasks, we show that CuatroLLM matches or outperforms state-of-the-art\nmultilingual models trained using closed data, such as Llama3.2 and Gemma2,\ndespite using an order of magnitude less data, such as about 6% of the tokens\nused for Llama3.2's training.

Moreover, stories are the more effective commonsense\nexpression for answering questions regarding daily events, while rules are more\neffective for scientific questions. This aligns with the reporting bias of\ncommonsense in text corpora. We further show that the correctness and relevance\nof commonsense stories can be further improved via iterative self-supervised\nfine-tuning.

However, due\nto architectural differences between these models and those employed in speech\nsynthesis, it remains uncertain whether RLHF could similarly benefit speech\nsynthesis models. In this paper, we explore the practical application of RLHF\nto diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis, leveraging the mean opinion score\n(MOS) as predicted by UTokyo-SaruLab MOS prediction system (Saeki et al., 2022)\nas a proxy loss. We introduce diffusion model loss-guided RL policy\noptimization (DLPO) and compare it against other RLHF approaches, employing the\nNISQA speech quality and naturalness assessment model (Mittag et al., 2021) and\nhuman preference experiments for further evaluation. Our results show that RLHF\ncan enhance diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis models, and, moreover,\nDLPO can better improve diffusion models in generating natural and high quality\nspeech audios.",

Several recent diffusion-based methods have shown comparable\nperformance by compressing videos to a lower-dimensional latent space, using\ntraditional video autoencoder architecture. However, such method that employ\nstandard frame-wise 2D and 3D convolution fail to fully exploit the\nspatio-temporal nature of videos. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nhybrid video diffusion model, called HVDM, which can capture spatio-temporal\ndependencies more effectively. The HVDM is trained by a hybrid video\nautoencoder which extracts a disentangled representation of the video\nincluding: (i) a global context information captured by a 2D projected latent\n(ii) a local volume information captured by 3D convolutions with wavelet\ndecomposition (iii) a frequency information for improving the video\nreconstruction. Based on this disentangled representation, our hybrid\nautoencoder provide a more comprehensive video latent enriching the generated\nvideos with fine structures and details. Experiments on video generation\nbenchamarks (UCF101, SkyTimelapse, and TaiChi) demonstrate that the proposed\napproach achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality, showing a wide\nrange of video applications (e.g., long video generation, image-to-video, and\nvideo dynamics control).",

Although existing\nautoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they\ndisrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an\nadditional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on\nVLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this\npaper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates\nthe strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single\nlarge language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the\ngeneration gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the\ndiffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe,\nwe find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other\nbut also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we\ndesign a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these\ntwo predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and\nreal-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while\ndemonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.",

Agents\nare modular components designed to perform specific tasks, such as translating\nbetween particular languages, with specializations like TranslateEnAgent,\nTranslateFrenchAgent, and TranslateJpAgent for English, French, and Japanese\ntranslations, respectively. These agents leverage the powerful semantic\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, to ensure\naccurate, contextually relevant translations while maintaining modularity,\nscalability, and context retention.\n  LangGraph, a graph-based framework built on LangChain, simplifies the\ncreation and management of these agents and their workflows. It supports\ndynamic state management, enabling agents to maintain dialogue context and\nautomates complex workflows by linking agents and facilitating their\ncollaboration. With flexibility, open-source community support, and seamless\nintegration with LLMs, LangGraph empowers agents to deliver high-quality\ntranslations.\n  Together, Agent AI and LangGraph create a cohesive system where LangGraph\norchestrates agent interactions, ensuring that user inputs are analyzed,\nrouted, and processed efficiently.

In order to foster advances in responsible\ninnovation, an in-depth understanding of the potential risks posed by these\nmodels is needed. A wide range of established and anticipated risks are\nanalysed in detail, drawing on multidisciplinary expertise and literature from\ncomputer science, linguistics, and social sciences.\n  We outline six specific risk areas: I. Discrimination, Exclusion and\nToxicity, II. Information Hazards, III. Misinformation Harms, V. Malicious\nUses, V. Human-Computer Interaction Harms, VI. Automation, Access, and\nEnvironmental Harms. The first area concerns the perpetuation of stereotypes,\nunfair discrimination, exclusionary norms, toxic language, and lower\nperformance by social group for LMs. The second focuses on risks from private\ndata leaks or LMs correctly inferring sensitive information. The third\naddresses risks arising from poor, false or misleading information including in\nsensitive domains, and knock-on risks such as the erosion of trust in shared\ninformation. The fourth considers risks from actors who try to use LMs to cause\nharm. The fifth focuses on risks specific to LLMs used to underpin\nconversational agents that interact with human users, including unsafe use,\nmanipulation or deception. The sixth discusses the risk of environmental harm,\njob automation, and other challenges that may have a disparate effect on\ndifferent social groups or communities.\n  In total, we review 21 risks in-depth. We discuss the points of origin of\ndifferent risks and point to potential mitigation approaches. Lastly, we\ndiscuss organisational responsibilities in implementing mitigations, and the\nrole of collaboration and participation. We highlight directions for further\nresearch, particularly on expanding the toolkit for assessing and evaluating\nthe outlined risks in LMs.",

To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of\nusing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for\nAIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding\ncapabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV\nevaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench.

However, VQA\nremains an extremely challenging task due to the diverse video content and the\ncomplex spatial and temporal distortions, thus necessitating more advanced\nmethods to address these issues. Nowadays, large multimodal models (LMMs), such\nas GPT-4V, have exhibited strong capabilities for various visual understanding\ntasks, motivating us to leverage the powerful multimodal representation ability\nof LMMs to solve the VQA task. Therefore, we propose the first Large\nMulti-Modal Video Quality Assessment (LMM-VQA) model, which introduces a novel\nspatiotemporal visual modeling strategy for quality-aware feature extraction.\nSpecifically, we first reformulate the quality regression problem into a\nquestion and answering (Q&A) task and construct Q&A prompts for VQA instruction\ntuning. Then, we design a spatiotemporal vision encoder to extract spatial and\ntemporal features to represent the quality characteristics of videos, which are\nsubsequently mapped into the language space by the spatiotemporal projector for\nmodality alignment. Finally, the aligned visual tokens and the quality-inquired\ntext tokens are aggregated as inputs for the large language model (LLM) to\ngenerate the quality score and level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLMM-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks,\nexhibiting an average improvement of $5\\%$ in generalization ability over\nexisting methods. Furthermore, due to the advanced design of the spatiotemporal\nencoder and projector, LMM-VQA also performs exceptionally well on general\nvideo understanding tasks, further validating its effectiveness.

However, existing methods struggle with \"copy-paste\" artifacts and low\nsimilarity issues, primarily due to their reliance on low-level facial image\ninformation. This dependence can result in rigid facial appearances and\nartifacts reflecting irrelevant details. To address these challenges, we\npropose EchoVideo, which employs two key strategies: (1) an Identity Image-Text\nFusion Module (IITF) that integrates high-level semantic features from text,\ncapturing clean facial identity representations while discarding occlusions,\nposes, and lighting variations to avoid the introduction of artifacts; (2) a\ntwo-stage training strategy, incorporating a stochastic method in the second\nphase to randomly utilize shallow facial information. The objective is to\nbalance the enhancements in fidelity provided by shallow features while\nmitigating excessive reliance on them. This strategy encourages the model to\nutilize high-level features during training, ultimately fostering a more robust\nrepresentation of facial identities. EchoVideo effectively preserves facial\nidentities and maintains full-body integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat it achieves excellent results in generating high-quality, controllability\nand fidelity videos.",

However, the extent to which existing perceptual metrics align with\nhuman perception remains unclear. To investigate this question, we introduce\nUniSim-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 7 multi-modal perceptual similarity\ntasks, with a total of 25 datasets. Our evaluation reveals that while\ngeneral-purpose models perform reasonably well on average, they often lag\nbehind specialized models on individual tasks. Conversely, metrics fine-tuned\nfor specific tasks fail to generalize well to unseen, though related, tasks. As\na first step towards a unified multi-task perceptual similarity metric, we\nfine-tune both encoder-based and generative vision-language models on a subset\nof the UniSim-Bench tasks. This approach yields the highest average\nperformance, and in some cases, even surpasses taskspecific models.\nNevertheless, these models still struggle with generalization to unseen tasks,\nhighlighting the ongoing challenge of learning a robust, unified perceptual\nsimilarity metric capable of capturing the human notion of similarity.

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation\nmodel for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from\nvision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both\nimage and video understanding benchmarks.",

Through extensive empirical studies\ninvolving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal\nscaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a\npower-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal\nbatch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex\noptimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size\nconditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We\ncontribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the\ncommunity. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the\nglobally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws\ndemonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training\ndata distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work\nthat unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts\nmodels and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter\nscaling laws across diverse data distributions.

We first rigorously prove the existence of a\nfew ``dominating experts'' in MoE models, whose outputs can determine the\noverall MoE's output. We also show that dormant experts can serve as dominating\nexperts to manipulate model predictions.

We then explore the algorithm design of\nMoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning,\nmeta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally,\nwe summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its\napplications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we\ndiscuss promising future research directions.",

The prowess of LLMs is underpinned by their substantial model size,\nextensive and diverse datasets, and the vast computational power harnessed\nduring training, all of which contribute to the emergent abilities of LLMs\n(e.g., in-context learning) that are not present in small models. Within this\ncontext, the mixture of experts (MoE) has emerged as an effective method for\nsubstantially scaling up model capacity with minimal computation overhead,\ngaining significant attention from academia and industry. Despite its growing\nprevalence, there lacks a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature\non MoE. This survey seeks to bridge that gap, serving as an essential resource\nfor researchers delving into the intricacies of MoE. We first briefly introduce\nthe structure of the MoE layer, followed by proposing a new taxonomy of MoE.\nNext, we overview the core designs for various MoE models including both\nalgorithmic and systemic aspects, alongside collections of available\nopen-source implementations, hyperparameter configurations and empirical\nevaluations. Furthermore, we delineate the multifaceted applications of MoE in\npractice, and outline some potential directions for future research.

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce the Directional Preference Alignment (DPA) framework.\nUnlike the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA incorporates multi-objective reward modeling\nto represent diverse preference profiles. Additionally, DPA models user\npreferences as directions (i.e., unit vectors) in the reward space to achieve\nuser-dependent preference control. Our method involves training a\nmulti-objective reward model and then fine-tuning the LLM with a\npreference-conditioned variant of Rejection Sampling Finetuning (RSF), an RLHF\nmethod adopted by Llama 2. This method enjoys a better performance trade-off\nacross various reward objectives. In comparison with the scalar-reward RLHF,\nDPA offers users intuitive control over LLM generation: they can arithmetically\nspecify their desired trade-offs (e.g., more helpfulness with less verbosity).\nWe also validate the effectiveness of DPA with real-world alignment experiments\non Mistral-7B.

At a high level, Q-probing sits\nbetween heavier approaches such as finetuning and lighter approaches such as\nfew shot prompting, but can also be combined with either. The idea is to learn\na simple linear function on a model's embedding space that can be used to\nreweight candidate completions. We theoretically show that this sampling\nprocedure is equivalent to a KL-constrained maximization of the Q-probe as the\nnumber of samples increases. To train the Q-probes we consider either reward\nmodeling or a class of novel direct policy learning objectives based on\nimportance weighted policy gradients. With this technique, we see gains in\ndomains with ground-truth rewards (code generation) as well as implicit rewards\ndefined by preference data, even outperforming finetuning in data-limited\nregimes.

In this paper, we investigate how the pre-training loss,\nsupervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the reasoning\nperformances of a supervised LLM. We find that pre-training loss is a better\nindicator of the model's performance than the model's parameter count. We apply\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with different amounts of supervised data and\nempirically find a log-linear relation between data amount and model\nperformance, and we find better models improve less with enlarged supervised\ndatasets. To augment more data samples for improving model performances without\nany human effort, we propose to apply Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). RFT\nuses supervised models to generate and collect correct reasoning paths as\naugmented fine-tuning datasets. We find with augmented samples containing more\ndistinct reasoning paths, RFT improves mathematical reasoning performance more\nfor LLMs. We also find RFT brings more improvement for less performant LLMs.\nFurthermore, we combine rejection samples from multiple models which push\nLLaMA-7B to an accuracy of 49.3\\% on GSM8K which outperforms the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) accuracy of 35.9\\% significantly.",

To address this\ndegradation, we employed model merging techniques, integrating single-task\ndomain-specific fine-tuned models with the base model.

Recently, direct preference\noptimization (DPO) is proposed to address those challenges. However, DPO relies\non contrastive responses generated from human annotator and alternative LLM,\ninstead of the policy model, limiting the effectiveness of the RLHF.

RS-DPO identifies\npairs of contrastive samples based on their reward distribution. Finally, we\napply DPO with the contrastive samples to align the model to human preference.\nOur experiments indicate that our proposed method effectively fine-tunes LLMs\nwith limited resource environments, leading to improved alignment with user\nintent.

Previous approaches have primarily utilized\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) via online RL methods such as\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Recently, offline methods such as Sequence\nLikelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nemerged as attractive alternatives, offering improvements in stability and\nscalability while maintaining competitive performance. SLiC refines its loss\nfunction using sequence pairs sampled from a supervised fine-tuned (SFT)\npolicy, while DPO directly optimizes language models based on preference data,\nforegoing the need for a separate reward model. However, the maximum likelihood\nestimator (MLE) of the target optimal policy requires labeled preference pairs\nsampled from that policy. DPO's lack of a reward model constrains its ability\nto sample preference pairs from the optimal policy, and SLiC is restricted to\nsampling preference pairs only from the SFT policy. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel approach called Statistical Rejection\nSampling Optimization (RSO) that aims to source preference data from the target\noptimal policy using rejection sampling, enabling a more accurate estimation of\nthe optimal policy. We also propose a unified framework that enhances the loss\nfunctions used in both SLiC and DPO from a preference modeling standpoint.\nThrough extensive experiments across three diverse tasks, we demonstrate that\nRSO consistently outperforms both SLiC and DPO on evaluations from both Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) and human raters.",

However, this surge presents challenges: (1) scattered benchmark\nknowledge across tasks, (2) difficulty in selecting relevant benchmarks, (3)\nthe absence of a uniform standard for benchmark development, and (4)\nlimitations of existing benchmarks. In this paper, we review 173 studies and\nidentify 204 AI4SE benchmarks. We classify these benchmarks, analyze their\nlimitations, and expose gaps in practices. Based on our review, we created\nBenchScout, a semantic search tool to find relevant benchmarks, using automated\nclustering of the contexts from associated studies. We conducted a user study\nwith 22 participants to evaluate BenchScout's usability, effectiveness, and\nintuitiveness which resulted in average scores of 4.5, 4.0, and 4.1 out of 5.\nTo advance benchmarking standards, we propose BenchFrame, a unified method to\nenhance benchmark quality. As a case study, we applied BenchFrame to the\nHumanEval benchmark and addressed its main limitations. This led to\nHumanEvalNext, featuring (1) corrected errors, (2) improved language\nconversion, (3) expanded test coverage, and (4) increased difficulty. We then\nevaluated ten state-of-the-art code language models on HumanEval,\nHumanEvalPlus, and HumanEvalNext. On HumanEvalNext, models showed a pass@1\nscore reduction of 31.22% and 19.94% compared to HumanEval and HumanEvalPlus,\nrespectively.",

Nevertheless, such LLM-based code\ngeneration approaches still struggle to generate error-free code in a few tries\nwhen faced with complex problems.

However, users of code generation systems usually expect to find a\ncorrect program by reviewing or testing only a small number of code candidates.\nOtherwise, the system would be unhelpful. In this paper, we propose Top Pass, a\ncode ranking approach that identifies potential correct solutions from a large\nnumber of candidates.

With the ability to follow instructions, current\nLLMs can be prompted to generate code solutions given detailed descriptions in\nnatural language. Many research efforts are being devoted to improving the\ncorrectness of LLM-generated code, and many benchmarks are proposed to evaluate\nthe correctness comprehensively. Despite the focus on correctness, the time\nefficiency of LLM-generated code solutions is under-explored. Current\ncorrectness benchmarks are not suitable for time efficiency evaluation since\ntheir test cases cannot well distinguish the time efficiency of different code\nsolutions. Besides, the current execution time measurement is not stable and\ncomprehensive, threatening the validity of the time efficiency evaluation.\n  To address the challenges in the time efficiency evaluation of code\ngeneration, we propose COFFE, a code generation benchmark for evaluating the\ntime efficiency of LLM-generated code solutions. COFFE contains 398 and 358\nproblems for function-level and file-level code generation, respectively. To\nimprove the distinguishability, we design a novel stressful test case\ngeneration approach with contracts and two new formats of test cases to improve\nthe accuracy of generation. For the time evaluation metric, we propose\nefficienct@k based on CPU instruction count to ensure a stable and solid\ncomparison between different solutions. We evaluate 14 popular LLMs on COFFE\nand identify four findings. Based on the findings, we draw some implications\nfor LLM researchers and software practitioners to facilitate future research\nand usage of LLMs in code generation.",

They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to\naddress the more complex one. This work features three key contributions.\nFirst, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of\nexisting benchmarks, resulting in three new benchmarks: HumanEval Pro, MBPP\nPro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, specifically designed to assess LLMs on\nself-invoking code generation. Second, from the analysis of experimental\nresults over twenty LLMs on our benchmarks, we have two important observations:\n(i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval\nand MBPP, but their performance declines on self-invoking tasks. For example,\no1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro.\n(ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models\ndemonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models. Third, we\ndisclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results. All\nthese results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking\ncode generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on\nenhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.",

NCB comprises 402\nhigh-quality problems in Python and Java, meticulously selected from natural\nuser queries from online coding services, covering 6 different domains. Noting\nthe extraordinary difficulty in creating testing cases for real-world queries,\nwe also introduce a semi-automated pipeline to enhance the efficiency of test\ncase construction. Comparing with manual solutions, it achieves an efficiency\nincrease of more than 4 times. Our systematic experiments on 39 LLMs find that\nperformance gaps on NCB between models with close HumanEval scores could still\nbe significant, indicating a lack of focus on practical code synthesis\nscenarios or over-specified optimization on HumanEval. On the other hand, even\nthe best-performing GPT-4 is still far from satisfying on NCB. The evaluation\ntoolkit and development set are available at\nhttps://github.com/THUDM/NaturalCodeBench.",

With the ability to follow instructions, current\nLLMs can be prompted to generate code solutions given detailed descriptions in\nnatural language. Many research efforts are being devoted to improving the\ncorrectness of LLM-generated code, and many benchmarks are proposed to evaluate\nthe correctness comprehensively. Despite the focus on correctness, the time\nefficiency of LLM-generated code solutions is under-explored. Current\ncorrectness benchmarks are not suitable for time efficiency evaluation since\ntheir test cases cannot well distinguish the time efficiency of different code\nsolutions. Besides, the current execution time measurement is not stable and\ncomprehensive, threatening the validity of the time efficiency evaluation.\n  To address the challenges in the time efficiency evaluation of code\ngeneration, we propose COFFE, a code generation benchmark for evaluating the\ntime efficiency of LLM-generated code solutions. COFFE contains 398 and 358\nproblems for function-level and file-level code generation, respectively. To\nimprove the distinguishability, we design a novel stressful test case\ngeneration approach with contracts and two new formats of test cases to improve\nthe accuracy of generation. For the time evaluation metric, we propose\nefficienct@k based on CPU instruction count to ensure a stable and solid\ncomparison between different solutions. We evaluate 14 popular LLMs on COFFE\nand identify four findings. Based on the findings, we draw some implications\nfor LLM researchers and software practitioners to facilitate future research\nand usage of LLMs in code generation.",

Automated systems such as\nLean can verify the correctness of proofs written in formal language, yet\nwriting the proofs in formal language can be challenging for humans and\nmachines. The miniF2F benchmark has 20 IMO problems in its test set, yet formal\nproofs are available only for 6 of these problems (3 of which are only written\nby mathematicians). The model with best accuracy can only prove 2 of these 20\nIMO problems, from 1950s and 60s, while its training set is a secret. In this\nwork, we write complete, original formal proofs for the remaining IMO problems\nin Lean along with 3 extra problems from IMO 2022 and 2023. This effort expands\nthe availability of proof currently in the public domain by creating 5,880\nlines of Lean proof. The goal of the paper is to pave the way for developing AI\nmodels that can automatically write the formal proofs for all the IMO problems\nin miniF2F and beyond by providing an evaluation benchmark. In this pursuit, we\ndevise a method to decompose the proofs of these problems into their building\nblocks, constructing a dataset of 1,329 lemmas with more than 40k lines of Lean\ncode. These lemmas are not trivial, yet they are approachable, providing the\nopportunity to evaluate and diagnose the failures and successes of AI models.\nWe evaluate the ability of the SOTA LLMs on our dataset and analyze their\nsuccess and failure modes from different perspectives.

They are designed for\nverifying each step of a proof in a formal language, and in recent years\nresearchers have created AI models to generate proofs in their languages.\nHowever, the scarcity of large-scale datasets of Lean proofs restrict the\nperformance of such Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) models.\n  We developed LeanNavigator, a novel method for generating a large-scale\ndataset of Lean theorems and proofs by finding new ways to prove existing Lean\ntheorems. By leveraging an interactive Lean client and an efficient method for\nproof step generation, LeanNavigator efficiently produces new theorems with\ncorresponding proofs. Applying this approach to Mathlib4, we generated 4.7\nmillion theorems totaling 1 billion tokens, surpassing previous datasets by\nmore than an order of magnitude. Using this extensive dataset, we trained an AI\nmodel that outperforms the state-of-the-art ReProver model in theorem-proving\ntasks.

We argue that the ability of current LLMs\nto prove statements largely depends on whether they have encountered the\nrelevant proof process during training. This reliance limits their deeper\nunderstanding of mathematical theorems and related concepts. Inspired by the\npedagogical method of \"proof by counterexamples\" commonly used in human\nmathematics education, our work aims to enhance LLMs' ability to conduct\nmathematical reasoning and proof through counterexamples. Specifically, we\nmanually create a high-quality, university-level mathematical benchmark,\nCounterMATH, which requires LLMs to prove mathematical statements by providing\ncounterexamples, thereby assessing their grasp of mathematical concepts.\nAdditionally, we develop a data engineering framework to automatically obtain\ntraining data for further model improvement. Extensive experiments and detailed\nanalyses demonstrate that CounterMATH is challenging, indicating that LLMs,\nsuch as OpenAI o1, have insufficient counterexample-driven proof capabilities.\nMoreover, our exploration into model training reveals that strengthening LLMs'\ncounterexample-driven conceptual reasoning abilities is crucial for improving\ntheir overall mathematical capabilities.

This survey provides a\ncomprehensive review of emerging techniques enhancing reasoning in LLMs. We\ncategorize existing methods into key approaches, including prompting strategies\n(e.g., Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Self-Consistency, and Tree-of-Thought\nreasoning), architectural innovations (e.g., retrieval-augmented models,\nmodular reasoning networks, and neuro-symbolic integration), and learning\nparadigms (e.g., fine-tuning with reasoning-specific datasets, reinforcement\nlearning, and self-supervised reasoning objectives). Additionally, we explore\nevaluation frameworks used to assess reasoning in LLMs and highlight open\nchallenges, such as hallucinations, robustness, and reasoning generalization\nacross diverse tasks.

To address this, we propose a novel\nframework HDFlow for complex reasoning with LLMs that combines fast and slow\nthinking modes in an adaptive manner. Our approach consists of two key\ncomponents: 1) a new approach for slow, deliberate reasoning called Dynamic\nWorkflow, which automatically decomposes complex problems into more manageable\nsub-tasks and dynamically designs a workflow to assemble specialized LLM or\nsymbolic reasoning tools to solve sub-tasks; 2) Hybrid Thinking, a general\nframework that dynamically combines fast and slow thinking based on problem\ncomplexity. Finally, we propose an easy-to-scale method for automatically\nsynthesizing a large-scale dataset of 27K challenging reasoning problems for\ncomplex reasoning and a hybrid thinking tuning method that trains smaller LLMs\non this dataset to internalize the fast/slow hybrid reasoning strategies.\nExperiments on four reasoning benchmark datasets demonstrate that our slow\nthinking with dynamic workflows significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thought, and\nhybrid thinking achieves the highest accuracy while providing an effective\nbalance between computational efficiency and performance. Fine-tuning using our\nhybrid thinking approach also significantly boosts the complex reasoning\ncapabilities of open-source language models.

Applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the sparse LLMs\noffers an intuitive approach to counter this predicament, while it holds\nshortcomings include: 1) The inability to integrate LoRA weights into sparse\nLLMs post-training, and 2) Insufficient performance recovery at high sparsity\nratios. In this paper, we introduce dynamic Low-rank Sparse Adaptation (LoSA),\na novel method that seamlessly integrates low-rank adaptation into LLM sparsity\nwithin a unified framework, thereby enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs\nwithout increasing the inference latency. In particular, LoSA dynamically\nsparsifies the LoRA outcomes based on the corresponding sparse weights during\nfine-tuning, thus guaranteeing that the LoRA module can be integrated into the\nsparse LLMs post-training. Besides, LoSA leverages Representation Mutual\nInformation (RMI) as an indicator to determine the importance of layers,\nthereby efficiently determining the layer-wise sparsity rates during\nfine-tuning. Predicated on this, LoSA adjusts the rank of the LoRA module based\non the variability in layer-wise reconstruction errors, allocating an\nappropriate fine-tuning for each layer to reduce the output discrepancies\nbetween dense and sparse LLMs. Extensive experiments tell that LoSA can\nefficiently boost the efficacy of sparse LLMs within a few hours, without\nintroducing any additional inferential burden.

Despite their impressive performance, VLMs\nare prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of\ncross-modal inconsistencies. Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused\non applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets\nto mitigate these issues. Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference\nsignals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual\ninformation in the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a\nnovel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a\ndual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual\npreference signals. We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard\ndirect preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual\npreference objective during fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous\nmethods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual\nquestion-answering (VQA) tasks. Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains\nrobustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures.\nThis work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs,\npaving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications.

However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first\nfitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then\nfine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize\nthis estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this\npaper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that\nenables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing\nus to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss.\nThe resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is\nstable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for\nsampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant\nhyperparameter tuning.

To address\nthis issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we\npropose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes\ndifferentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks.\nTPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between\nmultiple task-specific heads and the MLLM.

Our\ninstantiation of this approach with VideoChat and LLaVA demonstrates an overall\n14.6% improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models.\nAdditionally, MLLM-TPO demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across\nvarious tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models.

This unified training paradigm effectively\naddresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in\nconventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve\nperformance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position\nencoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced\npost-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed\npreference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies\nalongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of\nmulti-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the\nMMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its\ncapabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models,\nincluding ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also\nmaintaining strong pure-language proficiency.

However, they still often generate inaccurate or\nirrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or\nunrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V,\na novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning\ncapability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic\nprocess by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which\ngenerates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic,\nwhich provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach,\nthe Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can\nevolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This\ninteraction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning\nframework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar\nrewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on\ncomplex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by\nRule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results\nshow that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods,\nincluding GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning\naccuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner\nand constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more\nreliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach\nprovides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving\ntheir performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as\nautonomous driving and embodied intelligence.",

This study examines how VL adaptation influences safety and\nevaluates the impact of safety fine-tuning methods. Our analysis reveals that\nsafety degradation occurs during VL adaptation, even when the training data is\nsafe. While safety tuning techniques like supervised fine-tuning with safety\ndatasets or reinforcement learning from human feedback mitigate some risks,\nthey still lead to safety degradation and a reduction in helpfulness due to\nover-rejection issues. Further analysis of internal model weights suggests that\nVL adaptation may impact certain safety-related layers, potentially lowering\noverall safety levels. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the\nobjectives of VL adaptation and safety tuning are divergent, which often\nresults in their simultaneous application being suboptimal. To address this, we\nsuggest the weight merging approach as an optimal solution effectively reducing\nsafety degradation while maintaining helpfulness.

A leading method towards\nachieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially quantum\ngenerative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum\nmechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative learning\nmodels (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such, QGLMs are\nreceiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science\ncommunities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on\nnear-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are\nproposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the\nperspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs,\ncovering quantum circuit born machines, quantum generative adversarial\nnetworks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum autoencoders, as the quantum\nextension of classical generative learning models. In this context, we explore\ntheir intrinsic relation and their fundamental differences. We further\nsummarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional machine\nlearning tasks and quantum physics. Last, we discuss the challenges and further\nresearch directions for QGLMs.",

Our new framework\ndoes not require explicit probability distribution and performs the sampling\nvia Langevin dynamics. Our method is based on the key observation that the\nlocal energy is directly related to scores, defined as the gradient of the\nlogarithmic wavefunction. Inspired by the score matching and diffusion Monte\nCarlo methods, we derive a weighted score matching objective to guide our\nscore-based models to converge correctly to ground states. We first evaluate\nour approach with experiments on quantum harmonic traps, and results show that\nit can accurately learn ground states of atomic systems.

Despite the remarkable performance achieved by\nstate-of-the-art models like BERT in various natural language processing tasks,\nthey are found to remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in the input\ntext. In addressing the vulnerability of text classifiers to adversarial\nattacks, three distinct attack mechanisms are explored in this paper using the\nvictim model BERT: BERT-on-BERT attack, PWWS attack, and Fraud Bargain's Attack\n(FBA). Leveraging the IMDB, AG News, and SST2 datasets, a thorough comparative\nanalysis is conducted to assess the effectiveness of these attacks on the BERT\nclassifier model. It is revealed by the analysis that PWWS emerges as the most\npotent adversary, consistently outperforming other methods across multiple\nevaluation scenarios, thereby emphasizing its efficacy in generating\nadversarial examples for text classification. Through comprehensive\nexperimentation, the performance of these attacks is assessed and the findings\nindicate that the PWWS attack outperforms others, demonstrating lower runtime,\nhigher accuracy, and favorable semantic similarity scores.

            "abstract": "In the past few years, it has become increasingly evident that deep neural\nnetworks are not resilient enough to withstand adversarial perturbations in\ninput data, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Various authors have proposed\nstrong adversarial attacks for computer vision and Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) tasks. As a response, many defense mechanisms have also been proposed to\nprevent these networks from failing. The significance of defending neural\nnetworks against adversarial attacks lies in ensuring that the model's\npredictions remain unchanged even if the input data is perturbed. Several\nmethods for adversarial defense in NLP have been proposed, catering to\ndifferent NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and\nnatural language inference. Some of these methods not only defend neural\nnetworks against adversarial attacks but also act as a regularization mechanism\nduring training, saving the model from overfitting. This survey aims to review\nthe various methods proposed for adversarial defenses in NLP over the past few\nyears by introducing a novel taxonomy. The survey also highlights the fragility\nof advanced deep neural networks in NLP and the challenges involved in\ndefending them.",

This growth encompasses not just the creation of 3D objects, but\nalso the rapid development of 3D character and motion generation. Several key\nfactors contribute to this progress. The enhanced fidelity in stable diffusion,\ncoupled with control methods that ensure multi-view consistency, and realistic\nhuman models like SMPL-X, contribute synergistically to the production of 3D\nmodels with remarkable consistency and near-realistic appearances.

Since the\nyear 2023 an abundant amount of research papers has emerged in the domain of 3D\ngeneration. This growth encompasses not just the creation of 3D objects, but\nalso the rapid development of 3D character and motion generation. Several key\nfactors contribute to this progress. The enhanced fidelity in stable diffusion,\ncoupled with control methods that ensure multi-view consistency, and realistic\nhuman models like SMPL-X, contribute synergistically to the production of 3D\nmodels with remarkable consistency and near-realistic appearances. The\nadvancements in neural network-based 3D storing and rendering models, such as\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have\naccelerated the efficiency and realism of neural rendered models. Furthermore,\nthe multimodality capabilities of large language models have enabled language\ninputs to transcend into human motion outputs. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive overview and summary of the relevant papers published mostly\nduring the latter half year of 2023. It will begin by discussing the AI\ngenerated object models in 3D, followed by the generated 3D human models, and\nfinally, the generated 3D human motions, culminating in a conclusive summary\nand a vision for the future.",

Recently, this success has been extended to 3D AIGC,\nwith state-of-the-art methods generating textured 3D models from single images\nor text. However, we argue that current 3D AIGC methods still do not fully\nunleash human creativity. We often imagine 3D content made from multimodal\ninputs, such as what it would look like if my pet bunny were eating a doughnut\non the table. In this paper, we explore a novel 3D AIGC approach: generating 3D\ncontent from IDEAs. An IDEA is a multimodal input composed of text, image, and\n3D models. To our knowledge, this challenging and exciting 3D AIGC setting has\nnot been studied before. We propose the new framework Idea23D, which combines\nthree agents based on large multimodal models (LMMs) and existing algorithmic\ntools. These three LMM-based agents are tasked with prompt generation, model\nselection, and feedback reflection. They collaborate and critique each other in\na fully automated loop, without human intervention. The framework then\ngenerates a text prompt to create 3D models that align closely with the input\nIDEAs. We demonstrate impressive 3D AIGC results that surpass previous methods.\nTo comprehensively assess the 3D AIGC capabilities of Idea23D, we introduce the\nEval3DAIGC-198 dataset, containing 198 multimodal inputs for 3D generation\ntasks. This dataset evaluates the alignment between generated 3D content and\ninput IDEAs. Our user study and quantitative results show that Idea23D\nsignificantly improves the success rate and accuracy of 3D generation, with\nexcellent compatibility across various LMM, Text-to-Image, and Image-to-3D\nmodels.

To avoid these compromises,\nwe propose a novel framework for compositional scene generation, PhiP-G, which\nseamlessly integrates generation techniques with layout guidance based on a\nworld model.

For the stage of layout, PhiP-G employs a physical pool with adhesion\ncapabilities and a visual supervision agent, forming a world model for layout\nprediction and planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhiP-G\nsignificantly enhances the generation quality and physical rationality of the\ncompositional scenes.

However, current methods, which\npredominantly generate stories in an autoregressive and excessively\ncaption-dependent manner, often underrate the contextual consistency and\nrelevance of frames during sequential generation. To address this, we propose a\nnovel Rich-contextual Conditional Diffusion Models (RCDMs), a two-stage\napproach designed to enhance story generation's semantic consistency and\ntemporal consistency. Specifically, in the first stage, the frame-prior\ntransformer diffusion model is presented to predict the frame semantic\nembedding of the unknown clip by aligning the semantic correlations between the\ncaptions and frames of the known clip. The second stage establishes a robust\nmodel with rich contextual conditions, including reference images of the known\nclip, the predicted frame semantic embedding of the unknown clip, and text\nembeddings of all captions. By jointly injecting these rich contextual\nconditions at the image and feature levels, RCDMs can generate semantic and\ntemporal consistency stories. Moreover, RCDMs can generate consistent stories\nwith a single forward inference compared to autoregressive models. Our\nqualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed RCDMs\noutperform in challenging scenarios. The code and model will be available at\nhttps://github.com/muzishen/RCDMs.",

            "abstract": "The LLaMA family, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B\nto 65B parameters, has become one of the most powerful open-source large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and the popular LLM backbone of multi-modal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs), widely used in computer vision and natural language\nunderstanding tasks. In particular, LLaMA3 models have recently been released\nand have achieved impressive performance in various domains with super-large\nscale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of\nlow-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios, we explore\nLLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration can\npotentially provide new insights and challenges for the low-bit quantization of\nLLaMA3 and other future LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation\nissues that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we comprehensively\nevaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA fine-tuning\n(LoRA-FT) methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and various datasets to reveal the\nlow-bit quantization performance of LLaMA3. To uncover the capabilities of\nlow-bit quantized MLLM, we assessed the performance of the LLaMA3-based\nLLaVA-Next-8B model under 2-4 ultra-low bits with post-training quantization\nmethods. Our experimental results indicate that LLaMA3 still suffers from\nnon-negligible degradation in linguistic and visual contexts, particularly\nunder ultra-low bit widths. This highlights the significant performance gap at\nlow bit-width that needs to be addressed in future developments. We expect that\nthis empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, driving\nLLMs and MLLMs to achieve higher accuracy at lower bit to enhance practicality.\nOur project is released on https://github.com/Macaronlin/LLaMA3-Quantization ,\nand quantized models are released at https://huggingface.co/Efficient-ML .",

Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more\ncompute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,\ngenerally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost\nof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it\nimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a\nlightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several\ncomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)\nlow-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a\ndowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)\ncheckpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,\nleading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen\nas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model\ncan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied\nacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices\nquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with\nmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families\nand validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method\noutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the\nsame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.\nSpecifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of\nmemory.

Existing methods frequently encounter difficulties maintaining facial\ncoherence due to misalignments between facial landmarks extracted from driving\nvideos that provide head pose and expression cues and the facial geometry of\nthe reference images. To address this limitation, we introduce the Facial\nLandmarks Transformation (FLT) method, which leverages a 3D Morphable Model to\naddress this limitation. FLT converts 2D landmarks into a 3D face model,\nadjusts the 3D face model to align with the reference identity, and then\ntransforms them back into 2D landmarks to guide the image-to-video generation\nprocess. This approach ensures accurate alignment with the reference facial\ngeometry, enhancing the consistency between generated videos and reference\nimages. Experimental results demonstrate that FLT effectively preserves facial\nidentity, significantly improving pose-guided character animation models.",

While existing detection methods demonstrate\npromising results on benchmark datasets, they face critical limitations in\nreal-world applications. First, existing detectors typically fail to detect\nsemantic inconsistencies with the person's identity, such as implausible\nbehaviors or incompatible environmental contexts in given images. Second, these\nmethods rely heavily on low-level visual cues, making them effective for known\nforgeries but less reliable against new or unseen manipulation techniques. To\naddress these challenges, we present a novel personalized vision-language model\n(VLM) that integrates low-level visual artifact analysis and high-level\nsemantic inconsistency detection. Unlike previous VLM-based methods, our\napproach avoids resource-intensive supervised fine-tuning that often struggles\nto preserve distinct identity characteristics. Instead, we employ a lightweight\nmethod that dynamically encodes identity-specific information into specialized\nidentifier tokens. This design enables the model to learn distinct identity\ncharacteristics while maintaining robust generalization capabilities. We\nfurther enhance detection capabilities through a lightweight detection adapter\nthat extracts fine-grained information from shallow features of the vision\nencoder, preserving critical low-level evidence. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves 94.25% accuracy and 94.08% F1 score,\noutperforming both traditional forgery detectors and general VLMs while\nrequiring only 10 extra tokens.",

It is an important task in\nvideo generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper\npushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been\nresolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case\nfinetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based\ncontrol scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V\nmodel to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by\nprior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs\nidentity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be\ndecomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic\nfeatures. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial\nextractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent\nspace, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These\nfeatures are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate\ntraining challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency\nperspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency\ndetails and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability\nto preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy\nto leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a\nvanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an\noptimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our\nConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides\ntowards more effective IPT2V. Code: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID.",

However, vision-based\nsurveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally\nidentifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in\nvideo transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics,\nlimiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused\non privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various\nperspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving\nVideo Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current\nresearch in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on\nmethods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias\nconsiderations. To address this gap, this article systematically reviews the\nprogress of P2VAD for the first time, defining its scope and providing an\nintuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and\noptimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths,\nweaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to\nresearch resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we\ndiscuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI\ndevelopment and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.",

However, for planning tasks\nwith limited prior data (e.g., blocks world, advanced travel planning), the\nperformance of LLMs, including proprietary models like GPT and Gemini, is poor.\nThis paper investigates the impact of fine-tuning on the planning capabilities\nof LLMs, revealing that LLMs can achieve strong performance in planning through\nsubstantial (tens of thousands of specific examples) fine-tuning.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to this\nproblem, utilizing additional training or few-shot learning on examples of\nexisting tests. This paper presents a large-scale empirical evaluation on the\neffectiveness of LLMs for automated unit test generation without additional\ntraining or manual effort, providing the LLM with the signature and\nimplementation of the function under test, along with usage examples extracted\nfrom documentation. We also attempt to repair failed generated tests by\nre-prompting the model with the failing test and error message. We implement\nour approach in TestPilot, a test generation tool for JavaScript that\nautomatically generates unit tests for all API functions in an npm package. We\nevaluate TestPilot using OpenAI's gpt3.5-turbo LLM on 25 npm packages with a\ntotal of 1,684 API functions. The generated tests achieve a median statement\ncoverage of 70.2% and branch coverage of 52.8%, significantly improving on\nNessie, a recent feedback-directed JavaScript test generation technique, which\nachieves only 51.3% statement coverage and 25.6% branch coverage. We also find\nthat 92.8% of TestPilot's generated tests have no more than 50% similarity with\nexisting tests (as measured by normalized edit distance), with none of them\nbeing exact copies. Finally, we run TestPilot with two additional LLMs,\nOpenAI's older code-cushman-002 LLM and the open LLM StarCoder. Overall, we\nobserved similar results with the former (68.2% median statement coverage), and\nsomewhat worse results with the latter (54.0% median statement coverage),\nsuggesting that the effectiveness of the approach is influenced by the size and\ntraining set of the LLM, but does not fundamentally depend on the specific\nmodel.",

Benefiting from recent progress in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), LLM-based agents that use universal natural language as\nan interface exhibit robust generalization capabilities across various\napplications -- from serving as autonomous general-purpose task assistants to\napplications in coding, social, and economic domains, LLM-based agents offer\nextensive exploration opportunities. This paper surveys current research to\nprovide an in-depth overview of LLM-based intelligent agents within\nsingle-agent and multi-agent systems. It covers their definitions, research\nframeworks, and foundational components such as their composition, cognitive\nand planning methods, tool utilization, and responses to environmental\nfeedback. We also delve into the mechanisms of deploying LLM-based agents in\nmulti-agent systems, including multi-role collaboration, message passing, and\nstrategies to alleviate communication issues between agents.

In these\napplications, an LLM collaborates with various external modules, including APIs\nand even other LLMs, to realize complex intelligent services. However, we\nreveal that the intrinsic duration and structural uncertainty in compound LLM\napplications pose great challenges for LLM service providers in serving and\nscheduling them efficiently. In this paper, we propose LLMSched, an\nuncertainty-aware scheduling framework for emerging compound LLM applications.\nIn LLMSched, we first design a novel DAG-based model to describe the uncertain\ncompound LLM applications. Then, we adopt the Bayesian network to\ncomprehensively profile compound LLM applications and identify\nuncertainty-reducing stages, along with an entropy-based mechanism to quantify\ntheir uncertainty reduction. Combining an uncertainty reduction strategy and a\njob completion time (JCT)-efficient scheme, we further propose an efficient\nscheduler to reduce the average JCT. Evaluation of both simulation and testbed\nexperiments on various representative compound LLM applications shows that\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art scheduling schemes, LLMSched can reduce\nthe average JCT by 14~79%.",

However, established agent-based approaches in\ntransportation rely on multi-hierarchical mathematical models to simulate\ntravel behavior, which faces theoretical and practical limitations. The advent\nof large language models (LLM) provides a new opportunity to refine agent-based\nmodeling in transportation. LLM agents, which have impressive reasoning and\nplanning abilities, can serve as a proxy of human travelers and be integrated\ninto the modeling framework. However, despite evidence of their behavioral\nsoundness, no existing studies have assessed the impact and validity of\nLLM-agent-based simulations from a system perspective in transportation. This\npaper aims to address this issue by designing and integrating LLM agents with\nhuman-traveler-like characteristics into a simulation of a transportation\nsystem and assessing its performance based on existing benchmarks. Using the\nclassical transportation setting of the morning commute, we find that not only\ndo the agents exhibit fine behavioral soundness, but also produce system\ndynamics that align well with standard benchmarks.

On one side are over-optimistic claims\nthat LLMs can indeed do these tasks with just the right prompting or\nself-verification strategies. On the other side are perhaps over-pessimistic\nclaims that all that LLMs are good for in planning/reasoning tasks are as mere\ntranslators of the problem specification from one syntactic format to another,\nand ship the problem off to external symbolic solvers. In this position paper,\nwe take the view that both these extremes are misguided. We argue that\nauto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification\n(which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons\nfor misunderstandings in the literature. We will also argue that LLMs should be\nviewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much more\nmeaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple\nfront-end/back-end format translators. We present a vision of {\\bf LLM-Modulo\nFrameworks} that combine the strengths of LLMs with external model-based\nverifiers in a tighter bi-directional interaction regime. We will show how the\nmodels driving the external verifiers themselves can be acquired with the help\nof LLMs. We will also argue that rather than simply pipelining LLMs and\nsymbolic components, this LLM-Modulo Framework provides a better neuro-symbolic\napproach that offers tighter integration between LLMs and symbolic components,\nand allows extending the scope of model-based planning/reasoning regimes\ntowards more flexible knowledge, problem and preference specifications.",

Additionally, we highlight the necessity for\nexploration beyond the subgoals derived from BAIL by proving that naively\nexecuting the subgoals returned by LLM leads to a linear regret. As a remedy,\nwe introduce an $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy to BAIL, which is proven\nto incur sublinear regret when the pretraining error is small.

It encodes a transformed latent\nrepresentation using a static distribution whose parameters are learned during\ntraining. However, the actual distribution of the latent data may vary wildly\nacross different inputs. The static distribution attempts to encompass all\npossible input distributions, thus fitting none of them particularly well. This\nunfortunate phenomenon, sometimes known as the amortization gap, results in\nsuboptimal compression. To address this issue, we propose a method that\ndynamically adapts the encoding distribution to match the latent data\ndistribution for a specific input. First, our model estimates a better encoding\ndistribution for a given input. This distribution is then compressed and\ntransmitted as an additional side-information bitstream. Finally, the decoder\nreconstructs the encoding distribution and uses it to decompress the\ncorresponding latent data. Our method achieves a Bj{\\o}ntegaard-Delta (BD)-rate\ngain of -7.10% on the Kodak test dataset when applied to the standard\nfully-factorized architecture. Furthermore, considering computational\ncomplexity, the transform used by our method is an order of magnitude cheaper\nin terms of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations compared to related\nside-information methods such as the scale hyperprior.",

One such state-of-the-art method is\nknown as soft context formation (SCF). For each pixel to be encoded, a\nprobability distribution is estimated based on the neighboring pattern and the\noccurrence of that pattern in the already encoded image. Using an arithmetic\ncoder, the pixel color can thus be encoded very efficiently, provided that the\ncurrent color has been observed before in association with a similar pattern.\nIf this is not the case, the color is instead encoded using a color palette or,\nif it is still unknown, via residual coding. Both palette-based coding and\nresidual coding have significantly worse compression efficiency than coding\nbased on soft context formation. In this paper, the residual coding stage is\nimproved by adaptively trimming the probability distributions for the residual\nerror. Furthermore, an enhanced probability modeling for indicating a new color\ndepending on the occurrence of new colors in the neighborhood is proposed.\nThese modifications result in a bitrate reduction of up to 2.9% on average.\nCompared to HEVC (HM-16.21 + SCM-8.8) and FLIF, the improved SCF method saves\non average about 11% and 18% rate, respectively.",

To overcome the performance barrier of MLLIC, we question the very\nnecessity of MLLIC. Considering that all digital imaging sensors suffer from\nacquisition noises, why should we insist on mathematically lossless coding,\ni.e., wasting bits to preserve noises? Instead, we propose a new paradigm of\njoint denoising and compression called functionally lossless image compression\n(FLLIC), which performs lossless compression of optimally denoised images (the\noptimality may be task-specific). Although not literally lossless with respect\nto the noisy input, FLLIC aims to achieve the best possible reconstruction of\nthe latent noise-free original image. Extensive experiments show that FLLIC\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in joint denoising and compression of\nnoisy images and does so at a lower computational cost.",

This similarity suggests that\nICA provides a simple, yet principled model for studying feature learning.\nHere, we leverage this connection to investigate the interplay between data\nstructure and optimisation in feature learning for the most popular ICA\nalgorithm, FastICA, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is used to\ntrain deep networks. We rigorously establish that FastICA requires at least\n$n\\gtrsim d^4$ samples to recover a single non-Gaussian direction from\n$d$-dimensional inputs on a simple synthetic data model. We show that vanilla\nonline SGD outperforms FastICA, and prove that the optimal sample complexity $n\n\\gtrsim d^2$ can be reached by smoothing the loss, albeit in a data-dependent\nway. We finally demonstrate the existence of a search phase for FastICA on\nImageNet, and discuss how the strong non-Gaussianity of said images compensates\nfor the poor sample complexity of FastICA.",

Focusing on the spectral domain, we\nutilize an autoencoder architecture called the symmetric autoencoder (SymAE),\nwhich leverages permutation invariant representation and stochastic\nregularization in tandem to disentangle class-invariant 'coherent' features\nfrom variability-causing 'nuisance' features on a pixel-by-pixel basis.

In this\nwork, we systematically investigate the scaling laws of synthetic data by\nintroducing SynthLLM, a scalable framework that transforms pre-training corpora\ninto diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets. Our approach achieves this by\nautomatically extracting and recombining high-level concepts across multiple\ndocuments using a graph algorithm. Key findings from our extensive mathematical\nexperiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that\nreliably adheres to the rectified scaling law across various model sizes; (2)\nPerformance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models\napproach optimal performance with fewer training tokens.

            "abstract": "Synthetic data generation with Large Language Models is a promising paradigm\nfor augmenting natural data over a nearly infinite range of tasks. Given this\nvariety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are\nscarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what\nbottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of\nsynthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity,\nand complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in\nopen-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream\nmodels. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model\ngeneralization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize\nthe existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the\ndownstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various\ncomponents in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This\nexamination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation\nalgorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on\ndata QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance\nof balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and\nself-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data,\noften there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity\nwhich impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are\ncurrently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting\noutput diversity and the potential for self-improvement. We argue that\nbalancing these trade-offs is essential to the development of future\nself-improvement algorithms and highlight a number of works making progress in\nthis direction.",

However, we argue\nthat language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most\nword tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for\nreasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge\nchallenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an\nunrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new\nparadigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden\nstate of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed \"continuous\nthought\"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the\nLLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.\nExperiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several\nreasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent\nadvanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple\nalternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a\nsingle deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical\nreasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with\nfewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise\nof latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.",

            "abstract": "Synthetic data generation with Large Language Models is a promising paradigm\nfor augmenting natural data over a nearly infinite range of tasks. Given this\nvariety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are\nscarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what\nbottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of\nsynthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity,\nand complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in\nopen-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream\nmodels. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model\ngeneralization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize\nthe existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the\ndownstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various\ncomponents in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This\nexamination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation\nalgorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on\ndata QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance\nof balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and\nself-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data,\noften there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity\nwhich impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are\ncurrently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting\noutput diversity and the potential for self-improvement. We argue that\nbalancing these trade-offs is essential to the development of future\nself-improvement algorithms and highlight a number of works making progress in\nthis direction.",

We introduce\nSynthetic Educational Feedback Loops (SEFL), a novel framework designed to\ndeliver immediate, on-demand feedback at scale without relying on extensive,\nreal-world student data. In SEFL, two large language models (LLMs) operate in\nteacher--student roles to simulate assignment completion and formative\nfeedback, generating abundant synthetic pairs of student work and corresponding\ncritiques. We then fine-tune smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs on\nthese synthetic pairs, enabling them to replicate key features of high-quality,\ngoal-oriented feedback. Unlike personalized tutoring approaches that offer\nmulti-turn, individualized instruction, SEFL specifically focuses on\nreplicating the teacher-->student feedback loop for diverse assignments.\nThrough both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations, we demonstrate that\nSEFL-tuned models outperform their non-tuned counterparts in feedback quality,\nclarity, and timeliness.

Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more\ncompute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,\ngenerally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost\nof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it\nimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a\nlightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several\ncomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)\nlow-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a\ndowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)\ncheckpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,\nleading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen\nas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model\ncan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied\nacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices\nquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with\nmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families\nand validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method\noutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the\nsame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.\nSpecifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of\nmemory.

This trend has spurred active research into\nquantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while\nminimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous\nquantization-aware PEFT methods typically apply post-training quantization\n(PTQ) to pre-trained LLMs, followed by PEFT to recover accuracy loss.\nMeanwhile, this approach has limitations in recovering the accuracy loss. In\nthis paper, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware\nTraining (QAT) with LoRA. By employing a memory-optimized layer design, L4Q\nsignificantly reduces QAT's memory overhead, making its training cost\ncomparable to LoRA, while preserving the advantage of QAT in producing fully\nquantized LLMs with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that this\ncombined approach to quantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy\ncompared to decoupled fine-tuning schemes, particularly in 4-bit and 3-bit\nquantization, positioning L4Q as an efficient QAT solution.

Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more\ncompute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,\ngenerally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost\nof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it\nimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a\nlightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several\ncomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)\nlow-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a\ndowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)\ncheckpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,\nleading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen\nas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model\ncan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied\nacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices\nquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with\nmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families\nand validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method\noutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the\nsame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.\nSpecifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of\nmemory.

Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,\ngenerally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost\nof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it\nimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a\nlightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several\ncomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)\nlow-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a\ndowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)\ncheckpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,\nleading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen\nas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model\ncan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied\nacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices\nquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with\nmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families\nand validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method\noutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the\nsame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.\nSpecifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of\nmemory.

However, traditional approaches like RLHF or RLAIF treat the\nproblem as single-step. As focus shifts toward more complex reasoning and\nagentic tasks, language models must take multiple steps of text generation,\nreasoning and environment interaction before generating a solution. We propose\na synthetic data generation and RL methodology targeting multi-step\noptimization scenarios. This approach, called Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning\n(SWiRL), iteratively generates multi-step reasoning and tool use data, and then\nlearns from that data. It employs a simple step-wise decomposition that breaks\neach multi-step trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories corresponding to each\naction by the original model. It then applies synthetic data filtering and RL\noptimization on these sub-trajectories. We evaluated SWiRL on a number of\nmulti-step tool use, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Our\nexperiments show that SWiRL outperforms baseline approaches by 21.5%, 12.3%,\n14.8%, 11.1%, and 15.3% in relative accuracy on GSM8K, HotPotQA, CofCA,\nMuSiQue, and BeerQA, respectively.

To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT,\nSmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to\nguide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive\nexperiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for\nmathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the\noriginal MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset\nperformance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by\nan average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably,\nselecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most\nchallenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et\nal., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset\n(Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset\nusing only 50% of the data.

Typically,\ninstructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which\nare often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This,\nat scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance\nand robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for\nthe unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it\ngathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest\nprobability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most\nclosely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with\nstandard SFT training.\n  We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various\nsolutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune\ncommonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on\nGRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines,\nincluding distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to\n13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum\nperformance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to\nrealistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3\nand Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data\nby 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average\nperformance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs,\nGRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.",

This,\nat scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance\nand robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for\nthe unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it\ngathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest\nprobability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most\nclosely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with\nstandard SFT training.\n  We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various\nsolutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune\ncommonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on\nGRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines,\nincluding distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to\n13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum\nperformance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to\nrealistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3\nand Olmo-2.

Key findings from our extensive mathematical\nexperiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that\nreliably adheres to the rectified scaling law across various model sizes; (2)\nPerformance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models\napproach optimal performance with fewer training tokens. For instance, an 8B\nmodel peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T. Moreover, comparisons\nwith existing synthetic data generation and augmentation methods demonstrate\nthat SynthLLM achieves superior performance and scalability.

Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to\nunlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios.\nSeveral alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or\nhybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear,\nespecially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily\nverified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation\nstrategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation,\nQuestion Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs\ntrained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query\nbudget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across\nsettings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the\nratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed\ninstruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing\nquestions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new\nquestions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of\naugmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low\nto mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework\nfor selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into\naccount additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the\nimportance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for\nsynthetic data generation.",

However, the model size and performance of these long context\nmodels are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and\ninference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long\ninputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented\nGeneration (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the\ninput, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.\nThe core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,\nwhich does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest\nscores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this\nfrustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page\ndocuments using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,\nLLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG\nconsistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,\nFRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on\nVideo-MME.

However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy\nvisual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context\nlength cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant\nframes hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial.\nThis paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles:\nquery relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such\nas uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these\nprinciples. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with\ndynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and\nmodel-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nVideo-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the\nquery using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the\nsimilarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To\nincorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each\nsegment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov\ndecision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments.\nTheoretically, MDP3 provides a \\((1 - 1/e)\\)-approximate solution to the\nNP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time\ncomplexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly\noutperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.",

The extraction\nof representative key frames from videos is very important in video processing\nand analysis since it greatly reduces computing resources and time. Although\ngreat progress has been made recently, large-scale video classification remains\nan open problem, as the existing methods have not well balanced the performance\nand efficiency simultaneously. To tackle this problem, this work presents an\nunsupervised method to retrieve the key frames, which combines Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) and Temporal Segment Density Peaks Clustering (TSDPC). The\nproposed TSDPC is a generic and powerful framework and it has two advantages\ncompared with previous works, one is that it can calculate the number of key\nframes automatically. The other is that it can preserve the temporal\ninformation of the video. Thus it improves the efficiency of video\nclassification. Furthermore, a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is added\non the top of the CNN to further elevate the performance of classification.\nMoreover, a weight fusion strategy of different input networks is presented to\nboost the performance. By optimizing both video classification and key frame\nextraction simultaneously, we achieve better classification performance and\nhigher efficiency.

To address these challenges jointly, we propose a\nself-supervised framework that leverages Temporal Correspondence for video\nRepresentation learning (T-CoRe). For challenge 1), we propose a sandwich\nsampling strategy that selects two auxiliary frames to reduce reconstruction\nuncertainty in a two-side-squeezing manner.

However, many existing methods treat frames\nindependently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which\nlimits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long\nvideos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM\n(\\textbf{S}patiotemporal \\textbf{TO}ken \\textbf{R}eduction for\n\\textbf{M}ultimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated\ntemporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder\nleverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into\nimage tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame\ndynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only\nenhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token\nreduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal\nand spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM\nwithout sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques,\nour approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while\nimproving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over\nextended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves\nstate-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks\n(more than 5\\% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the\ncomputation costs by up to $8\\times$ and the decoding latency by\n2.4-2.9$\\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

However, training a robust deep neural network necessitates a\nlarge amount of labeled training data, acquiring which involves significant\ntime and human effort. This problem is even more serious for an application\nlike video classification, where a human annotator has to watch an entire video\nend-to-end to furnish a label. Active learning algorithms automatically\nidentify the most informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data;\nthis tremendously reduces the human annotation effort in inducing a machine\nlearning model, as only the few samples that are identified by the algorithm,\nneed to be labeled manually. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning\nframework for video classification, with the goal of further reducing the\nlabeling onus on the human annotators. Our framework identifies a batch of\nexemplar videos, together with a set of informative frames for each video; the\nhuman annotator needs to merely review the frames and provide a label for each\nvideo. This involves much less manual work than watching the complete video to\ncome up with a label. We formulate a criterion based on uncertainty and\ndiversity to identify the informative videos and exploit representative\nsampling techniques to extract a set of exemplar frames from each video. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to develop an active\nlearning framework for video classification, where the annotators need to\ninspect only a few frames to produce a label, rather than watching the\nend-to-end video.",

However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy\nvisual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context\nlength cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant\nframes hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial.\nThis paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles:\nquery relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such\nas uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these\nprinciples. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with\ndynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and\nmodel-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nVideo-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the\nquery using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the\nsimilarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To\nincorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each\nsegment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov\ndecision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments.\nTheoretically, MDP3 provides a \\((1 - 1/e)\\)-approximate solution to the\nNP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time\ncomplexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly\noutperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.",

We first pre-train scalable DPLMs from\nevolutionary-scale protein sequences within a generative self-supervised\ndiscrete diffusion probabilistic framework, which generalizes language modeling\nfor proteins in a principled way. After pre-training, DPLM exhibits the ability\nto generate structurally plausible, novel, and diverse protein sequences for\nunconditional generation. We further demonstrate the proposed diffusion\ngenerative pre-training makes DPLM possess a better understanding of proteins,\nmaking it a superior representation learner, which can be fine-tuned for\nvarious predictive tasks, comparing favorably to ESM2 (Lin et al., 2022).\nMoreover, DPLM can be tailored for various needs, which showcases its prowess\nof conditional generation in several ways: (1) conditioning on partial peptide\nsequences, e.g., generating scaffolds for functional motifs with high success\nrate; (2) incorporating other modalities as conditioner, e.g.,\nstructure-conditioned generation for inverse folding; and (3) steering sequence\ngeneration towards desired properties, e.g., satisfying specified secondary\nstructures, through a plug-and-play classifier guidance.

Inspired by the success of these foundation models,\nresearchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains,\nincluding small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, RNA and even cells.\nHowever, these models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability\nto integrate across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities\nwithin these domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form\nthe \"language of nature\", we introduce Nature Language Model (NatureLM), a\nsequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery.\nPre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers a\nunified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i)\ngenerating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using\ntext instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as\nprotein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) top performance\nacross different domains, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art specialist\nmodels. NatureLM offers a promising generalist approach for various scientific\ntasks, including drug discovery (hit generation/optimization, ADMET\noptimization, synthesis), novel material design, and the development of\ntherapeutic proteins or nucleotides.

On the other hand, specialized solvers like\nLaMBO-2 offer efficiency and fine-grained control but require more domain\nexpertise. Comparing these approaches is challenging due to expensive\nlaboratory validation and inadequate synthetic benchmarks. We address this by\nintroducing Ehrlich functions, a synthetic test suite that captures the\ngeometric structure of biophysical sequence optimization problems. With\nprompting alone, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to optimize Ehrlich functions. In\nresponse, we propose LLOME (Language Model Optimization with Margin\nExpectation), a bilevel optimization routine for online black-box optimization.\nWhen combined with a novel preference learning loss, we find LLOME can not only\nlearn to solve some Ehrlich functions, but can even outperform LaMBO-2 on\nmoderately difficult Ehrlich variants. However, LLOME is comparable to LaMBO-2\non very easy or difficult variants, exhibits some likelihood-reward\nmiscalibration, and struggles without explicit rewards. Our results indicate\nLLMs can provide significant benefits in some cases, but specialized solvers\nare still competitive and incur less overhead.",

We first pre-train scalable DPLMs from\nevolutionary-scale protein sequences within a generative self-supervised\ndiscrete diffusion probabilistic framework, which generalizes language modeling\nfor proteins in a principled way. After pre-training, DPLM exhibits the ability\nto generate structurally plausible, novel, and diverse protein sequences for\nunconditional generation. We further demonstrate the proposed diffusion\ngenerative pre-training makes DPLM possess a better understanding of proteins,\nmaking it a superior representation learner, which can be fine-tuned for\nvarious predictive tasks, comparing favorably to ESM2 (Lin et al., 2022).\nMoreover, DPLM can be tailored for various needs, which showcases its prowess\nof conditional generation in several ways: (1) conditioning on partial peptide\nsequences, e.g., generating scaffolds for functional motifs with high success\nrate; (2) incorporating other modalities as conditioner, e.g.,\nstructure-conditioned generation for inverse folding; and (3) steering sequence\ngeneration towards desired properties, e.g., satisfying specified secondary\nstructures, through a plug-and-play classifier guidance.

Functional Encryption enables data owners to\ngrant third-party access to perform specified computations without disclosing\ntheir inputs.

The ubiquitousness of machine learning has led to the\ncollection of massive private data in the cloud computing environment. This\nraises potential privacy issues and the need for more private and secure\ncomputing solutions. Numerous efforts have been made in privacy-preserving\nmachine learning (PPML) to address security and privacy concerns.

However,\nFE-based PPML is still in its infancy and has not yet gotten much attention\ncompared to FHE-based PPML approaches. In this paper, we provide a\nsystematization of PPML works based on FE summarizing state-of-the-art in the\nliterature. We focus on Inner-product-FE and Quadratic-FE-based machine\nlearning models for the PPML applications. We analyze the performance and\nusability of the available FE libraries and their applications to PPML. We also\ndiscuss potential directions for FE-based PPML approaches.

One such approach is the use of Homomorphic\nEncryption (HE). However, the significant drawbacks and inefficiencies of\ntraditional HE render it impractical for highly scalable scenarios.\nFortunately, a modern cryptographic scheme, Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption\n(HHE), has recently emerged, combining the strengths of symmetric cryptography\nand HE to surmount these challenges.

We leverage HHE as the\nfundamental building block to enable secure learning of classification outcomes\nover encrypted data, all while preserving the privacy of the input data and ML\nmodel. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our construction by\ndeveloping and evaluating an HHE-based PPML application for classifying heart\ndisease based on sensitive ECG data. Notably, our evaluations revealed a slight\nreduction in accuracy compared to inference on plaintext data. Additionally,\nboth the analyst and end devices experience minimal communication and\ncomputation costs, underscoring the practical viability of our approach.

Blockchain fortifies the\nunlearning process through its inherent qualities of immutability,\ntransparency, and robust security. It facilitates verifiable certification,\nharmonizes security with privacy, and sustains system efficiency. We introduce\na framework that melds blockchain with federated learning, thereby ensuring an\nimmutable record of unlearning requests and actions. This strategy not only\nbolsters the trustworthiness and integrity of the federated learning model but\nalso adeptly addresses efficiency and security challenges typical in IoT\nenvironments. Our key contributions encompass a certification mechanism for the\nunlearning process, the enhancement of data security and privacy, and the\noptimization of data management to ensure system responsiveness in IoT\nscenarios.",

Prioritization of privacy can limit\nthe effectiveness of these interactions, as achieving certain goals\nnecessitates sharing private data. Traditionally, addressing this challenge has\ninvolved either seeking trusted intermediaries or constructing cryptographic\nprotocols that restrict how much data is revealed, such as multi-party\ncomputations or zero-knowledge proofs. While significant advances have been\nmade in scaling cryptographic approaches, they remain limited in terms of the\nsize and complexity of applications they can be used for. In this paper, we\nargue that capable machine learning models can fulfill the role of a trusted\nthird party, thus enabling secure computations for applications that were\npreviously infeasible. In particular, we describe Trusted Capable Model\nEnvironments (TCMEs) as an alternative approach for scaling secure computation,\nwhere capable machine learning model(s) interact under input/output\nconstraints, with explicit information flow control and explicit statelessness.\nThis approach aims to achieve a balance between privacy and computational\nefficiency, enabling private inference where classical cryptographic solutions\nare currently infeasible. We describe a number of use cases that are enabled by\nTCME, and show that even some simple classic cryptographic problems can already\nbe solved with TCME.

Notably, the proposed framework ensures the\nprivacy of the training data from all actors of the learning process, namely\nthe data owners and the aggregating server. More precisely, while HE blinds a\nsemi-honest server during the learning protocol, DP protects the data from\nsemi-honest clients participating in the training process as well as end-users\nwith black-box or white-box access to the trained model. In order to achieve\nthis, we provide new theoretical and practical results to allow these\ntechniques to be rigorously combined. In particular, by means of a novel\nstochastic quantisation operator, we prove DP guarantees in a context where the\nnoise is quantised and bounded due to the use of HE. The paper is concluded by\nexperiments which show the practicality of the entire framework in terms of\nboth model quality (impacted by DP) and computational overhead (impacted by\nHE).",

Unlike\ntraditional FL, our framework enables secure, decentralized authentication and\nencryption directly on IoT devices using DABE, allowing sensitive data to\nremain locally encrypted. Homomorphic Encryption permits computations on\nencrypted data, and SMPC ensures privacy in collaborative computations, while\nBlockchain technology provides transparent, immutable record-keeping for all\ntransactions and model updates. Local model weights are encrypted and\ntransmitted to fog layers for aggregation using HE and SMPC, then iteratively\nrefined by the central server using differential privacy to safeguard against\ndata leakage. This secure, privacy-preserving FL framework delivers a robust\nsolution for efficient model training and real-time analytics across\ndistributed IoT devices, offering significant advancements in secure\ndecentralized learning for IoT applications.",

The traditional centralized\nmachine learning method, where data is collected from end-users or IoT devices,\nso that it can discover insights behind real-world data, may not be feasible\nfor many data-driven industry applications in light of such regulations. A new\nmachine learning method, coined by Google as Federated Learning (FL) enables\nmultiple participants to train a machine learning model collectively without\ndirectly exchanging data. However, recent studies have shown that there is\nstill a possibility to exploit the shared models to extract personal or\nconfidential data. In this paper, we propose to adopt Multi Party Computation\n(MPC) to achieve privacy-preserving model aggregation for FL. The MPC-enabled\nmodel aggregation in a peer-to-peer manner incurs high communication overhead\nwith low scalability. To address this problem, the authors proposed to develop\na two-phase mechanism by 1) electing a small committee and 2) providing\nMPC-enabled model aggregation service to a larger number of participants\nthrough the committee. The MPC enabled FL framework has been integrated in an\nIoT platform for smart manufacturing. It enables a set of companies to train\nhigh quality models collectively by leveraging their complementary data-sets on\ntheir own premises, without compromising privacy, model accuracy vis-a-vis\ntraditional machine learning methods and execution efficiency in terms of\ncommunication cost and execution time.",

These MPC protocols are\nconstructed using the well-known secret-sharing-based paradigm (SPDZ and\nSPDZ2k), where the protocols ensure security against a malicious adversary by\ncomputing Message Authentication Code (MAC) tags on the input shares and then\nevaluating the circuit with these input shares and tags. However, this tag\ncomputation adds a significant runtime overhead, particularly for machine\nlearning (ML) applications with numerous linear computation layers such as\nconvolutions and fully connected layers.\n  To alleviate the tag computation overhead, we introduce CompactTag, a\nlightweight algorithm for generating MAC tags specifically tailored for linear\nlayers in ML. Linear layer operations in ML, including convolutions, can be\ntransformed into Toeplitz matrix multiplications. For the multiplication of two\nmatrices with dimensions T1 x T2 and T2 x T3 respectively, SPDZ2k required O(T1\nx T2 x T3) local multiplications for the tag computation. In contrast,\nCompactTag only requires O(T1 x T2 + T1 x T3 + T2 x T3) local multiplications,\nresulting in a substantial performance boost for various ML models.\n  We empirically compared our protocol to the SPDZ2k protocol for various ML\ncircuits, including ResNet Training-Inference, Transformer Training-Inference,\nand VGG16 Training-Inference. SPDZ2k dedicated around 30% of its online runtime\nfor tag computation.

Most existing\nmethods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting\nintricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control\nprecision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts,\nthus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts.\nSpecifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle\nstatic and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change\nproperty to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables,\nenabling independent control over motion and identity. To establish the\ntheoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the\nidentifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we\ndesign a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce\nthe minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the\ndimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional\nindependence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in\nfor GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video\ngeneration benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves\ngeneration quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.",

To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel Extrapolating and Decoupling framework, which introduces model\nmerging techniques to the I2V domain for the first time.

(2) We introduce a training-free extrapolation strategy\nto amplify the dynamic range of the motion, effectively reversing the\nfine-tuning process to enhance the motion degree significantly. (3) With the\nabove two-stage models excelling in motion controllability and degree, we\ndecouple the relevant parameters associated with each type of motion ability\nand inject them into the base I2V-DM. Since the I2V-DM handles different levels\nof motion controllability and dynamics at various denoising time steps, we\nadjust the motion-aware parameters accordingly over time.

To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such\nas VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors\nlike per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence.\nHowever, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus\non whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres\nto real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on\nthese metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just\nvisually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real \"world models\"\nthrough video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to\nensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning,\nanatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of\nrealism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and\nsimulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a\nnext-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative\nmodels for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key\ndimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and\nCommonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored\nfor individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such\nas state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection\nmethods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive annotations to\nensure alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial\nfaithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new\nstandard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of\nintrinsic faithfulness.",

The evaluation metrics\nwith fine-grained levels reveal individual models' strengths and weaknesses. 2)\nHuman Alignment: We also provide a dataset of human preference annotations to\nvalidate our benchmarks' alignment with human perception, for each evaluation\ndimension respectively. 3) Valuable Insights: We look into current models'\nability across various evaluation dimensions, and various content types.

Most existing\nmethods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting\nintricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control\nprecision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts,\nthus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts.\nSpecifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle\nstatic and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change\nproperty to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables,\nenabling independent control over motion and identity. To establish the\ntheoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the\nidentifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we\ndesign a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce\nthe minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the\ndimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional\nindependence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in\nfor GANs.

Despite this, their\ndeficiencies in physical cognition have gradually received widespread attention\n- generated content often violates the fundamental laws of physics, falling\ninto the dilemma of ''visual realism but physical absurdity\". Researchers began\nto increasingly recognize the importance of physical fidelity in video\ngeneration and attempted to integrate heuristic physical cognition such as\nmotion representations and physical knowledge into generative systems to\nsimulate real-world dynamic scenarios. Considering the lack of a systematic\noverview in this field, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive summary of\narchitecture designs and their applications to fill this gap. Specifically, we\ndiscuss and organize the evolutionary process of physical cognition in video\ngeneration from a cognitive science perspective, while proposing a three-tier\ntaxonomy: 1) basic schema perception for generation, 2) passive cognition of\nphysical knowledge for generation, and 3) active cognition for world\nsimulation, encompassing state-of-the-art methods, classical paradigms, and\nbenchmarks. Subsequently, we emphasize the inherent key challenges in this\ndomain and delineate potential pathways for future research, contributing to\nadvancing the frontiers of discussion in both academia and industry. Through\nstructured review and interdisciplinary analysis, this survey aims to provide\ndirectional guidance for developing interpretable, controllable, and physically\nconsistent video generation paradigms, thereby propelling generative models\nfrom the stage of ''visual mimicry'' towards a new phase of ''human-like\nphysical comprehension''.",

However, precise control over\nthe video generation process, such as camera manipulation or content editing,\nremains a significant challenge. Existing methods for controlled video\ngeneration are typically limited to a single control type, lacking the\nflexibility to handle diverse control demands. In this paper, we introduce\nDiffusion as Shader (DaS), a novel approach that supports multiple video\ncontrol tasks within a unified architecture. Our key insight is that achieving\nversatile video control necessitates leveraging 3D control signals, as videos\nare fundamentally 2D renderings of dynamic 3D content. Unlike prior methods\nlimited to 2D control signals, DaS leverages 3D tracking videos as control\ninputs, making the video diffusion process inherently 3D-aware. This innovation\nallows DaS to achieve a wide range of video controls by simply manipulating the\n3D tracking videos. A further advantage of using 3D tracking videos is their\nability to effectively link frames, significantly enhancing the temporal\nconsistency of the generated videos. With just 3 days of fine-tuning on 8 H800\nGPUs using less than 10k videos, DaS demonstrates strong control capabilities\nacross diverse tasks, including mesh-to-video generation, camera control,\nmotion transfer, and object manipulation.",

While many existing methods depend on additional\ncontrol modules or inference-time fine-tuning, recent studies suggest that\neffective motion guidance is achievable without altering the model architecture\nor requiring extra training. Such approaches offer promising compatibility with\nvarious video generation foundation models. However, existing training-free\nmethods often struggle to maintain consistent temporal coherence across frames\nor to follow guided motion accurately. In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective solution that combines an initial-noise-based approach with a novel\nmotion consistency loss, the latter being our key innovation. Specifically, we\ncapture the inter-frame feature correlation patterns of intermediate features\nfrom a video diffusion model to represent the motion pattern of the reference\nvideo. We then design a motion consistency loss to maintain similar feature\ncorrelation patterns in the generated video, using the gradient of this loss in\nthe latent space to guide the generation process for precise motion control.\nThis approach improves temporal consistency across various motion control tasks\nwhile preserving the benefits of a training-free setup.

To address these issues, we introduce Embodied Mobile\nManipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), which requires agents to interpret\nuser instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space.\nEMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a\nunified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment.\nAdditionally, we collect EMMOE-100, which features in various task attributes,\ndetailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for\nLLM training. Furthermore, we design HomieBot, a sophisticated agent system\nconsists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted\nnavigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms.\nFinally, we demonstrate HomieBot's performance and the evaluation of different\nmodels and policies.",

However, robotics\nfaces unique challenges in scaling data and establishing evaluation protocols.\nCollecting real-world data is resource-intensive and inefficient, while\nbenchmarking in real-world scenarios remains highly complex. Synthetic data and\nsimulation offer promising alternatives, yet existing efforts often fall short\nin data quality, diversity, and benchmark standardization. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce RoboVerse, a comprehensive framework comprising a\nsimulation platform, a synthetic dataset, and unified benchmarks. Our\nsimulation platform supports multiple simulators and robotic embodiments,\nenabling seamless transitions between different environments. The synthetic\ndataset, featuring high-fidelity physics and photorealistic rendering, is\nconstructed through multiple approaches. Additionally, we propose unified\nbenchmarks for imitation learning and reinforcement learning, enabling\nevaluation across different levels of generalization. At the core of the\nsimulation platform is MetaSim, an infrastructure that abstracts diverse\nsimulation environments into a universal interface. It restructures existing\nsimulation environments into a simulator-agnostic configuration system, as well\nas an API aligning different simulator functionalities, such as launching\nsimulation environments, loading assets with initial states, stepping the\nphysics engine, etc. This abstraction ensures interoperability and\nextensibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RoboVerse enhances\nthe performance of imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world model\nlearning, and sim-to-real transfer. These results validate the reliability of\nour dataset and benchmarks, establishing RoboVerse as a robust solution for\nadvancing robot learning.",

To this end, we have generated dataset with 224k\nepisodes (150 hours, 1,104 language instructions) which includes dual-arm fine\ntasks such as bowl-moving, pencil-case opening or banana-peeling, and this data\nis publicly available. Additionally, this dataset includes visual attention\nsignals as well as dual-action labels, a signal that separates actions into a\nrobust reaching trajectory and precise interaction with objects, and language\ninstructions to achieve robust and precise object manipulation. We applied the\ndataset to our Dual-Action and Attention (DAA), a model designed for\nfine-grained dual arm manipulation tasks and robust against covariate shifts.\nThe model was tested with over 7k total trials in real robot manipulation\ntasks, demonstrating its capability in fine manipulation.",

Despite this progress,\nmost existing works have primarily focused on utilizing raw images to aid LLMs\nin understanding environmental information. However, this approach not only\nlimits the scope of observation but also typically necessitates extensive\nmultimodal data collection and large-scale models. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach called Graph-based Robotic Instruction Decomposer (GRID), which\nleverages scene graphs instead of images to perceive global scene information\nand iteratively plan subtasks for a given instruction. Our method encodes\nobject attributes and relationships in graphs through an LLM and Graph\nAttention Networks, integrating instruction features to predict subtasks\nconsisting of pre-defined robot actions and target objects in the scene graph.\nThis strategy enables robots to acquire semantic knowledge widely observed in\nthe environment from the scene graph. To train and evaluate GRID, we establish\na dataset construction pipeline to generate synthetic datasets for graph-based\nrobotic task planning. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms GPT-4\nby over 25.4% in subtask accuracy and 43.6% in task accuracy. Moreover, our\nmethod achieves a real-time speed of 0.11s per inference. Experiments conducted\non datasets of unseen scenes and scenes with varying numbers of objects\ndemonstrate that the task accuracy of GRID declined by at most 3.8%, showcasing\nits robust cross-scene generalization ability. We validate our method in both\nphysical simulation and the real world. More details can be found on the\nproject page https://jackyzengl.github.io/GRID.github.io/.",

To address this,\nwe propose AnyPlace, a two-stage method trained entirely on synthetic data,\ncapable of predicting a wide range of feasible placement poses for real-world\ntasks. Our key insight is that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to\nidentify rough placement locations, we focus only on the relevant regions for\nlocal placement, which enables us to train the low-level\nplacement-pose-prediction model to capture diverse placements efficiently. For\ntraining, we generate a fully synthetic dataset of randomly generated objects\nin different placement configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train\nlocal placement-prediction models. We conduct extensive evaluations in\nsimulation, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of\nsuccess rate, coverage of possible placement modes, and precision. In\nreal-world experiments, we show how our approach directly transfers models\ntrained purely on synthetic data to the real world, where it successfully\nperforms placements in scenarios where other models struggle -- such as with\nvarying object geometries, diverse placement modes, and achieving high\nprecision for fine placement.

These perturbations include changes in\ncolor, texture, and size of objects, table-tops, and backgrounds; we also vary\nlighting, distractors, physical properties perturbations and camera pose. Using\nTHE COLOSSEUM, we compare 5 state-of-the-art manipulation models to reveal that\ntheir success rate degrades between 30-50% across these perturbation factors.\nWhen multiple perturbations are applied in unison, the success rate degrades\n$\\geq$75%. We identify that changing the number of distractor objects, target\nobject color, or lighting conditions are the perturbations that reduce model\nperformance the most. To verify the ecological validity of our results, we show\nthat our results in simulation are correlated ($\\bar{R}^2 = 0.614$) to similar\nperturbations in real-world experiments. We open source code for others to use\nTHE COLOSSEUM, and also release code to 3D print the objects used to replicate\nthe real-world perturbations. Ultimately, we hope that THE COLOSSEUM will serve\nas a benchmark to identify modeling decisions that systematically improve\ngeneralization for manipulation.

Hierarchical approaches offer\na pathway for achieving this goal by executing skill combinations arranged by a\ntask planner, with each visuomotor skill pre-trained using a specific imitation\nlearning (IL) algorithm. However, even in simple long-horizon tasks like skill\nchaining, hierarchical approaches often struggle due to a problem we identify\nas Observation Space Shift (OSS), where the sequential execution of preceding\nskills causes shifts in the observation space, disrupting the performance of\nsubsequent individually trained skill policies. To validate OSS and evaluate\nits impact on long-horizon tasks, we introduce BOSS (a Benchmark for\nObservation Space Shift). BOSS comprises three distinct challenges: \"Single\nPredicate Shift\", \"Accumulated Predicate Shift\", and \"Skill Chaining\", each\ndesigned to assess a different aspect of OSS's negative effect. We evaluated\nseveral recent popular IL algorithms on BOSS, including three Behavioral\nCloning methods and the Visual Language Action model OpenVLA. Even on the\nsimplest challenge, we observed average performance drops of 67%, 35%, 34%, and\n54%, respectively, when comparing skill performance with and without OSS.\nAdditionally, we investigate a potential solution to OSS that scales up the\ntraining data for each skill with a larger and more visually diverse set of\ndemonstrations, with our results showing it is not sufficient to resolve OSS.\nThe project page is: https://boss-benchmark.github.io/",

While the ML community has\nbeen exploring the potential of LLMs in such multi-agent setups, varying\nassumptions, design choices and evaluation criteria across studies make it\ndifficult to draw robust and meaningful conclusions. To address this, we\nintroduce a benchmark for standardizing research on two-player, sequential,\nlanguage-based games.

We develop an open-source framework for\ninteraction simulation and analysis, and utilize it to collect a dataset of LLM\nvs. LLM interactions across numerous game configurations and an additional\ndataset of human vs. LLM interactions. Through extensive experimentation, we\ndemonstrate how our framework and dataset can be used to: (i) compare the\nbehavior of LLM-based agents to human players in various economic contexts;\n(ii) evaluate agents in both individual and collective performance measures;\nand (iii) quantify the effect of the economic characteristics of the\nenvironments on the behavior of agents.",

At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language\nmodels (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that\ninteract with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how\nperformant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform\nwork-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for\nboth industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy\nto understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To\nmeasure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world\nprofessional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible\nbenchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways\nto those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running\nprograms, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained\nenvironment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software\ncompany environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by\nworkers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed\nAPI-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most\ncompetitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints\na nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating\na real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously,\nbut more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current\nsystems.",

These\nchallenges include capturing open-ended behaviors, handling emergent outcomes,\nand enabling continuous adaptation over the agent's lifecycle. To address these\nissues, we propose an evaluation-driven development approach, inspired by\ntest-driven and behavior-driven development but reimagined for the unique\ncharacteristics of LLM agents. Through a multivocal literature review (MLR), we\nsynthesize the limitations of existing LLM evaluation methods and introduce a\nnovel process model and reference architecture tailored for evaluation-driven\ndevelopment of LLM agents. Our approach integrates online (runtime) and offline\n(redevelopment) evaluations, enabling adaptive runtime adjustments and\nsystematic iterative refinement of pipelines, artifacts, system architecture,\nand LLMs themselves. By continuously incorporating evaluation results,\nincluding fine-grained feedback from human and AI evaluators, into each stage\nof development and operation, this framework ensures that LLM agents remain\naligned with evolving goals, user needs, and governance standards.",

In this\nstudy, we introduce a novel framework called LLMFactor, which employs\nSequential Knowledge-Guided Prompting (SKGP) to identify factors that influence\nstock movements using LLMs. Unlike previous methods that relied on keyphrases\nor sentiment analysis, this approach focuses on extracting factors more\ndirectly related to stock market dynamics, providing clear explanations for\ncomplex temporal changes. Our framework directs the LLMs to create background\nknowledge through a fill-in-the-blank strategy and then discerns potential\nfactors affecting stock prices from related news. Guided by background\nknowledge and identified factors, we leverage historical stock prices in\ntextual format to predict stock movement.

Meanwhile, we compare two simple methods of integrating LLMs'\ntoken-level representations into the forecasting module. The experiments on\nreal news and investment universes reveal that: (1) aggregated representations\nfrom LLMs' token-level embeddings generally produce return predictions that\nenhance the performance of long-only and long-short portfolios; (2) in the\nrelatively large investment universe, the decoder LLMs-based prediction model\nleads to stronger portfolios, whereas in the small universes, there are no\nconsistent winners.

Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have brought new ways to improve these predictions. While recent\nfinancial large language models (FinLLMs) have shown considerable progress in\nfinancial NLP tasks compared to smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs),\nchallenges persist in stock price forecasting. Firstly, effectively integrating\nthe modalities of time series data and natural language to fully leverage these\ncapabilities remains complex. Secondly, FinLLMs focus more on analysis and\ninterpretability, which can overlook the essential features of time series\ndata. Moreover, due to the abundance of false and redundant information in\nfinancial markets, models often produce less accurate predictions when faced\nwith such input data. In this paper, we introduce StockTime, a novel LLM-based\narchitecture designed specifically for stock price data. Unlike recent FinLLMs,\nStockTime is specifically designed for stock price time series data. It\nleverages the natural ability of LLMs to predict the next token by treating\nstock prices as consecutive tokens, extracting textual information such as\nstock correlations, statistical trends and timestamps directly from these stock\nprices. StockTime then integrates both textual and time series data into the\nembedding space. By fusing this multimodal data, StockTime effectively predicts\nstock prices across arbitrary look-back periods. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat StockTime outperforms recent LLMs, as it gives more accurate predictions\nwhile reducing memory usage and runtime costs.",

We hypothesize that the\nhistorical market reactions to words, offer a more reliable indicator of their\npotential impact on markets than subjective sentiment interpretations by human\nannotators. To test this hypothesis, a market-derived labeling approach is\nproposed to assign tweet labels based on ensuing short-term price trends,\nenabling the language model to capture the relationship between textual signals\nand market dynamics directly. A domain-specific language model was fine-tuned\non these labels, achieving up to an 11% improvement in short-term trend\nprediction accuracy over traditional sentiment-based benchmarks. Moreover, by\nincorporating market and temporal context through prompt-tuning, the proposed\ncontext-aware language model demonstrated an accuracy of 89.6% on a curated\ndataset of 227 impactful Bitcoin-related news events with significant market\nimpacts. Aggregating daily tweet predictions into trading signals, our method\noutperformed traditional fusion models (which combine sentiment-based and\nprice-based predictions). It challenged the assumption that sentiment-based\nsignals are inferior to price-based predictions in forecasting market\nmovements. Backtesting these signals across three distinct market regimes\nyielded robust Sharpe ratios of up to 5.07 in trending markets and 3.73 in\nneutral markets.

However, their application in the financial\ndomain remains relatively limited. The financial field is inherently complex,\nrequiring a deep understanding across various perspectives, from macro, micro\neconomic trend to quantitative analysis. Motivated by this complexity, a\nmixture of expert LLMs tailored to specific financial domains could offer a\nmore comprehensive understanding for intricate financial tasks. In this paper,\nwe present the FinTeamExperts, a role-specialized LLM framework structured as a\nMixture of Experts (MOEs) for financial analysis. The framework simulates a\ncollaborative team setting by training each model to specialize in distinct\nroles: Macro Analysts, Micro analysts, and Quantitative Analysts. This\nrole-specific specialization enhances the model's ability to integrate their\ndomain-specific expertise. We achieve this by training three 8-billion\nparameter models on different corpus, each dedicated to excelling in specific\nfinance-related roles. We then instruct-tune FinTeamExperts on downstream tasks\nto align with practical financial tasks. The experimental results show that\nFinTeamExperts outperform all models of the same size and larger on three out\nof four datasets. On the fourth dataset, which presents a more complex task,\nFinTeamExperts still surpass all models of the same size. This highlights the\nsuccess of our role-based specialization approach and the continued training\napproach for FinTeamExperts.",

We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from\nJanuary 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs,\nincluding BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary\nmodel, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The\nstudy documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent\ndaily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the\nhighest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly\nahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald\ndictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1%\naccuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model\nscores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in\ndifferent model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive\nrelevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant\nrelationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock\nreturns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current\nfinancial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels\nwith a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT\nlong-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary\nyield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior\nperformance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction\nand portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of\nfinancial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy\nanalysis.",

            "abstract": "Alpha mining, a critical component in quantitative investment, focuses on\ndiscovering predictive signals for future asset returns in increasingly complex\nfinancial markets. However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors\nlose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha\nmining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay\nfrom overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language\nModels (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing\nknowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate\ndecay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous\nframework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations\nfor mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key\nmechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on\nabstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor\nalignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and\ngenerated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural\nconstraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to\noverfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process\nto balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving\nmarket conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations\nshow that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in\nmitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering\nsignificant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&P 500 markets over the past four\nyears. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay,\nelevating the potential for yielding powerful factors.",

The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated\nonline has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information.

Our agent addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB\nvisual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate\nhuman cognitive processes during gameplay. The AVA architecture consists of\nthree integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with\nspecialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and\nbattlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that\nleverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions,\nand (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated\nmulti-agent behavior. The experimental evaluation in our proposed AVACraft\nenvironment, which contains 21 multimodal StarCraft II scenarios, demonstrates\nthat AVA powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can\nexecute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving\ncomparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial\ntraining iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing\nhuman-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of\nmultimodal game AI.

In this paper, we assess the merits of these existing\nevaluation metrics and present a novel approach to evaluation called the\nStandardised Test Suite (STS). The STS uses behavioural scenarios mined from\nreal human interaction data. Agents see replayed scenario context, receive an\ninstruction, and are then given control to complete the interaction offline.\nThese agent continuations are recorded and sent to human annotators to mark as\nsuccess or failure, and agents are ranked according to the proportion of\ncontinuations in which they succeed. The resulting STS is fast, controlled,\ninterpretable, and representative of naturalistic interactions. Altogether, the\nSTS consolidates much of what is desirable across many of our standard\nevaluation metrics, allowing us to accelerate research progress towards\nproducing agents that can interact naturally with humans.

Existing\napproaches can handle certain long-horizon tasks in an open world. However,\nthey still struggle when the number of open-world tasks could potentially be\ninfinite and lack the capability to progressively enhance task completion as\ngame time progresses. We introduce JARVIS-1, an open-world agent that can\nperceive multimodal input (visual observations and human instructions),\ngenerate sophisticated plans, and perform embodied control, all within the\npopular yet challenging open-world Minecraft universe. Specifically, we develop\nJARVIS-1 on top of pre-trained multimodal language models, which map visual\nobservations and textual instructions to plans. The plans will be ultimately\ndispatched to the goal-conditioned controllers. We outfit JARVIS-1 with a\nmultimodal memory, which facilitates planning using both pre-trained knowledge\nand its actual game survival experiences. JARVIS-1 is the existing most general\nagent in Minecraft, capable of completing over 200 different tasks using\ncontrol and observation space similar to humans. These tasks range from\nshort-horizon tasks, e.g., \"chopping trees\" to long-horizon tasks, e.g.,\n\"obtaining a diamond pickaxe\". JARVIS-1 performs exceptionally well in\nshort-horizon tasks, achieving nearly perfect performance. In the classic\nlong-term task of $\\texttt{ObtainDiamondPickaxe}$, JARVIS-1 surpasses the\nreliability of current state-of-the-art agents by 5 times and can successfully\ncomplete longer-horizon and more challenging tasks.

In\nthis paper, we propose Dynamic World Simulation (DWS), a novel approach to\ntransform pre-trained video generative models into controllable world\nsimulators capable of executing specified action trajectories. To achieve\nprecise alignment between conditioned actions and generated visual changes, we\nintroduce a lightweight, universal action-conditioned module that seamlessly\nintegrates into any existing model. Instead of focusing on complex visual\ndetails, we demonstrate that consistent dynamic transition modeling is the key\nto building powerful world simulators. Building upon this insight, we further\nintroduce a motion-reinforced loss that enhances action controllability by\ncompelling the model to capture dynamic changes more effectively. Experiments\ndemonstrate that DWS can be versatilely applied to both diffusion and\nautoregressive transformer models, achieving significant improvements in\ngenerating action-controllable, dynamically consistent videos across games and\nrobotics domains. Moreover, to facilitate the applications of the learned world\nsimulator in downstream tasks such as model-based reinforcement learning, we\npropose prioritized imagination to improve sample efficiency, demonstrating\ncompetitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

One of the most popular research areas involves\napplying these agents to video games. Traditionally, these methods have relied\non game APIs to access in-game environmental and action data. However, this\napproach is limited by the availability of APIs and does not reflect how humans\nplay games. With the advent of vision language models (VLMs), agents now have\nenhanced visual understanding capabilities, enabling them to interact with\ngames using only visual inputs. Despite these advances, current approaches\nstill face challenges in action-oriented tasks, particularly in action\nrole-playing games (ARPGs), where reinforcement learning methods are prevalent\nbut suffer from poor generalization and require extensive training. To address\nthese limitations, we select an ARPG, ``Black Myth: Wukong'', as a research\nplatform to explore the capability boundaries of existing VLMs in scenarios\nrequiring visual-only input and complex action output. We define 12 tasks\nwithin the game, with 75% focusing on combat, and incorporate several\nstate-of-the-art VLMs into this benchmark. Additionally, we will release a\nhuman operation dataset containing recorded gameplay videos and operation logs,\nincluding mouse and keyboard actions. Moreover, we propose a novel VARP (Vision\nAction Role-Playing) agent framework, consisting of an action planning system\nand a visual trajectory system. Our framework demonstrates the ability to\nperform basic tasks and succeed in 90% of easy and medium-level combat\nscenarios.

In this paper, we develop\nan application-level testbed based on the open-source strategy game \"Unciv\",\nwhich has millions of active players, to enable researchers to build a \"data\nflywheel\" for studying human-like agents in the \"digital players\" task. This\n\"Civilization\"-like game features expansive decision-making spaces along with\nrich linguistic interactions such as diplomatic negotiations and acts of\ndeception, posing significant challenges for LLM-based agents in terms of\nnumerical reasoning and long-term planning. Another challenge for \"digital\nplayers\" is to generate human-like responses for social interaction,\ncollaboration, and negotiation with human players.

Techniques like prompting, reasoning, tool\nutilization, and in-context learning are being explored to enhance their\ncapabilities. Evaluation platforms like AgentBench, WebArena, and ToolLLM\nprovide robust methods for assessing these agents in complex scenarios.
