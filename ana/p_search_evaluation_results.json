However, we observe that in\nstandard decoder-style LLMs, attention matrices degenerate to single-column for\ndeeper layers. Layers in this state are unable to learn anything meaningful and\nmostly redundant; we refer to these as lazy layers. The goal of this paper is\nto train smaller models by eliminating this structural inefficiency without\ncompromising performance.\n  Motivated by this observation, we propose Inheritune, a simple yet effective\ntraining recipe for developing smaller, high-performing language models.\nSmaller models trained with Inheritune, inherit early transformer layers from a\nlarger pre-trained model, then retrain and progressively expand until they\nmatch or exceed the performance of the larger model. We demonstrate that\nInheritune enables the training of various sizes of GPT-2 models on datasets\nlike OpenWebText-9B and FineWeb_edu. Models trained with Inheritune, despite\nhaving significantly fewer layers, match or even surpass the performance of\ntheir larger counterparts. For instance, our 16-layer GPT-2 medium variant\nachieves comparable performance to the standard 24-layer GPT-2 medium model.\nCode is available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/LLM-Inheritune.",

By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to\nover 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for\ncompute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens\nshould be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of\ntraining tokens should also be doubled.

As their\nadoption accelerates, the sustainability of LLMs has become a critical issue,\nnecessitating strategies to optimize their runtime efficiency without\ncompromising performance. Hence, it is imperative to identify the parameters\nthat significantly influence the performance and energy efficiency of LLMs. To\nthat end, in this work, we investigate the effect of important parameters on\nthe performance and energy efficiency of LLMs during inference and examine\ntheir trade-offs.\n  First, we analyze how different types of models with varying numbers of\nparameters and architectures perform on tasks like text generation, question\nanswering, and summarization by benchmarking LLMs such as Falcon-7B,\nMistral-7B-v0.1, T5-3B, GPT-2, GPT-J-6B, and GPT-Neo-2.7B. Second, we study\ninput and output sequence characteristics such as sequence length concerning\nenergy consumption, performance, and throughput. Finally, we explore the impact\nof hardware-based power-saving techniques, i.e., Dynamic Voltage Frequency\nScaling (DVFS), on the models' latency and energy efficiency.

It is currently uncertain whether increasing the size of LLMs\neffectively improves performance in D2T tasks across these three qualities. The\nobjective of this study is to investigate the performance of fine-tuned LLMs in\nD2T tasks in terms of model size. Through extensive comparative analysis, we\naim to elucidate both the advantages and limitations of scaling model sizes\nacross five widely used D2T datasets (E2E, ViGGo, WikiTableText, DART, and\nWebNLG) and twelve state-of-the-art LLMs with varying sizes from five different\nLLM families (T5, BART, OPT, BLOOM, and Llama 2).

We observe that most smaller LLMs, even after fine-tuning,\nfail to outperform larger zero-shot LLMs in meeting summarization datasets.\nHowever, a notable exception is FLAN-T5 (780M parameters), which performs on\npar or even better than many zero-shot Larger LLMs (from 7B to above 70B\nparameters), while being significantly smaller.

However, relationships between the two abilities\nand how such relationships affect the emergence of ICL is unclear. In this\npaper, we take the first step by examining the pre-training dynamics of the\nemergence of ICL.

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of\nour datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for\nunderstanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language\nmodels, and practically improving their performance.",

However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their\nability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining\nsemantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we\nprovide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what\nthe pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in\naccordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take\ninspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy\n\"graph tracing\" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts\nseen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the\ngraph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given\nexemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze\nintermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of\ncontext is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic\nrepresentations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure.\nFurther, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their\nsemantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure\nis still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the\npretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy\nminimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an\nimplicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall,\nour findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model\nrepresentations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.",

Model adaptation techniques, such as fine-tuning\nand parameter-efficient training have been shown to store new facts at a slow\nrate; continual learning is an option but is costly and prone to catastrophic\nforgetting. This work studies and quantifies how PLM may learn and remember new\nworld knowledge facts that do not occur in their pre-training corpus, which\nonly contains world knowledge up to a certain date. To that purpose, we first\npropose Novel-WD, a new dataset consisting of sentences containing novel facts\nextracted from recent Wikidata updates, along with two evaluation tasks in the\nform of causal language modeling and multiple choice questions (MCQ). We make\nthis dataset freely available to the community, and release a procedure to\nlater build new versions of similar datasets with up-to-date information. We\nalso explore the use of prefix-tuning for novel information learning, and\nanalyze how much information can be stored within a given prefix. We show that\na single fact can reliably be encoded within a single prefix, and that the\nprefix capacity increases with its length and with the base model size.",

Since\nexisting works concentrate mostly on continual fine-tuning for a limited\nselection of downstream tasks or training domains, we introduce a new benchmark\ndesigned to measure the adaptability of LLMs to changing pretraining data\nlandscapes. We further examine the impact of model size on learning efficacy\nand forgetting, as well as how the progression and similarity of emerging\ndomains affect the knowledge transfer within these models.\n  Our findings uncover several key insights: (i) continual pretraining\nconsistently improves <1.5B models studied in this work and is also superior to\ndomain adaptation, (ii) larger models always achieve better perplexity than\nsmaller ones when continually pretrained on the same corpus, (iii) smaller\nmodels are particularly sensitive to continual pretraining, showing the most\nsignificant rates of both learning and forgetting, (iv) continual pretraining\nboosts downstream task performance of GPT-2 family, (v) continual pretraining\nenables LLMs to specialize better when the sequence of domains shows semantic\nsimilarity while randomizing training domains leads to better transfer and\nfinal performance otherwise.

We instead present In-Context Pretraining, a new\napproach where language models are pretrained on a sequence of related\ndocuments, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across\ndocument boundaries. We can do In-Context Pretraining by simply changing the\ndocument ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directly\napplying existing pretraining pipelines.

There are billions of documents and we would like the sort to\nmaximize contextual similarity for every document without repeating any data.\nTo do this, we introduce approximate algorithms for finding related documents\nwith efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent input contexts\nwith a graph traversal algorithm. Our experiments show In-Context Pretraining\noffers a simple and scalable approach to significantly enhance LMs'performance:\nwe see notable improvements in tasks that require more complex contextual\nreasoning, including in-context learning (+8%), reading comprehension (+15%),\nfaithfulness to previous contexts (+16%), long-context reasoning (+5%), and\nretrieval augmentation (+9%).",

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of\nour datasets and other benchmarks.

Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational\nresources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion\ndynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic,\nand temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel\nframework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for\nlong video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range\ntemporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model.\nSpecifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of\nthe DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and\nbalancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive\nnorm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual\nunits from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during\nvideo generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced\nfrom the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent\ntokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on\neight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in\ndynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on\nthe remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process. In\naddition, ARLON achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation.\nDetailed analyses of the improvements in inference efficiency are presented,\nalongside a practical application that demonstrates the generation of long\nvideos using progressive text prompts.

            "abstract": "With the advance of diffusion models, today's video generation has achieved\nimpressive quality. But generating temporal consistent long videos is still\nchallenging. A majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate long videos\nin an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on\nlast frames of previous clip. However, existing approaches all involve\nbidirectional computations, which restricts the receptive context of each\nautoregression step, and results in the model lacking long-term dependencies.\nInspired from the huge success of large language models (LLMs) and following\nGPT (generative pre-trained transformer), we bring causal (i.e.,\nunidirectional) generation into VDMs, and use past frames as prompt to generate\nfuture frames. For Causal Generation, we introduce causal temporal attention\ninto VDM, which forces each generated frame to depend on its previous frames.\nFor Frame as Prompt, we inject the conditional frames by concatenating them\nwith noisy frames (frames to be generated) along the temporal axis.\nConsequently, we present Video Diffusion GPT (ViD-GPT). Based on the two key\ndesigns, in each autoregression step, it is able to acquire long-term context\nfrom prompting frames concatenated by all previously generated frames.\nAdditionally, we bring the kv-cache mechanism to VDMs, which eliminates the\nredundant computation from overlapped frames, significantly boosting the\ninference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ViD-GPT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on long\nvideo generation.

The generation of a single frame requires the model to process\nthe entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by\nadapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive\ntransformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we\nextend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step\ndiffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality\ndistillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's\nODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that\nsupervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach\neffectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing\nlong-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model\nachieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all\nprevious video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of\nhigh-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our\napproach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and\ndynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an\nopen-source model in the future.",

            "abstract": "Autoregressive modeling has been a huge success in the field of natural\nlanguage processing (NLP). Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a\nsignificant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing\nhigh-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on\nsubword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can\nvary in different levels, \\textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or\nscale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data\ncompared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively\nexamines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve\nreadability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with\npreliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the\nfundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general\nsub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models\nbased on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections\nbetween autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we\npresent a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer\nvision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and\nmulti-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse\ndomains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with\nabout 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to\nautoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research\ndirections. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers\nincluded in this survey at:\n\\url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.",

            "abstract": "Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language\ngeneration, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended\ntemporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is\ncomputationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language\ntokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range\ndependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution\nshort-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an\nunlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer\ntokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a\nmanageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time\nand memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to\nsupport the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on\nlong video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet\neffective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.

To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world\napplications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an\nautoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the\nlast frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are\nhighly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional\nframes that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated\nwhen the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model\nwith long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase\nsignificantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression\nstep). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with\nCausal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces\nunidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional\nframes can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every\nsubsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it\nshares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage\ncost. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Ca2-VDM achieves\nstate-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative video generation results and\nsignificantly improves the generation speed.

            "abstract": "Text-to-video models have recently undergone rapid and substantial\nadvancements. Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational\nresources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion\ndynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic,\nand temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel\nframework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for\nlong video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range\ntemporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model.\nSpecifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of\nthe DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and\nbalancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive\nnorm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual\nunits from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during\nvideo generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced\nfrom the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent\ntokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on\neight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in\ndynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on\nthe remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process. In\naddition, ARLON achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation.\nDetailed analyses of the improvements in inference efficiency are presented,\nalongside a practical application that demonstrates the generation of long\nvideos using progressive text prompts.

            "abstract": "Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language\ngeneration, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended\ntemporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is\ncomputationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language\ntokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range\ndependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution\nshort-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an\nunlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer\ntokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a\nmanageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time\nand memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to\nsupport the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on\nlong video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet\neffective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.

However, the transformers are prohibited from directly learning the\nlong-term dependency in videos due to the quadratic complexity of\nself-attention, and inherently suffering from slow inference time and error\npropagation due to the autoregressive process. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-efficient Bidirectional Transformer (MeBT) for end-to-end learning of\nlong-term dependency in videos and fast inference. Based on recent advances in\nbidirectional transformers, our method learns to decode the entire\nspatio-temporal volume of a video in parallel from partially observed patches.\nThe proposed transformer achieves a linear time complexity in both encoding and\ndecoding, by projecting observable context tokens into a fixed number of latent\ntokens and conditioning them to decode the masked tokens through the\ncross-attention. Empowered by linear complexity and bidirectional modeling, our\nmethod demonstrates significant improvement over the autoregressive\nTransformers for generating moderately long videos in both quality and speed.\nVideos and code are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mebt-cvpr2023 .",

As such, one natural question arises: Is it possible to have a\nunified model for both understanding and generation? To answer this question,\nin this paper, we first provide a detailed review of both MLLM and diffusion\nmodels, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal\narchitecture design, and advanced applications to image/video large language\nmodels as well as text-to-image/video generation. Then, we discuss the two\nimportant questions on the unified model: i) whether the unified model should\nadopt the auto-regressive or diffusion probabilistic modeling, and ii) whether\nthe model should utilize a dense architecture or the Mixture of Experts(MoE)\narchitectures to better support generation and understanding, two objectives.\nWe further provide several possible strategies for building a unified model and\nanalyze their potential advantages and disadvantages. We also summarize\nexisting large-scale multi-modal datasets for better model pretraining in the\nfuture.

The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact.

Rather than adapting a\ntext-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model\n(MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and\nlinguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora\nduring a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively\naddresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in\nconventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve\nperformance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position\nencoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced\npost-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed\npreference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies\nalongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of\nmulti-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the\nMMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its\ncapabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models,\nincluding ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also\nmaintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science\nprinciples, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights\nto foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.",

For example, ERNIE-ViL, Oscar and UNIMO trained VLPMs with\na uniform transformers stack architecture and large amounts of image-text\npaired data, achieving remarkable results on downstream tasks such as\nimage-text reference(IR and TR), vision question answering (VQA) and image\ncaptioning (IC) etc. During the training phase, VLPMs are always fed with a\ncombination of multiple public datasets to meet the demand of large-scare\ntraining data. However, due to the unevenness of data distribution including\nsize, task type and quality, using the mixture of multiple datasets for model\ntraining can be problematic. In this work, we introduce a large-scale\nmulti-modal corpora named WuDaoMM, totally containing more than 650M image-text\npairs. Specifically, about 600 million pairs of data are collected from\nmultiple webpages in which image and caption present weak correlation, and the\nother 50 million strong-related image-text pairs are collected from some\nhigh-quality graphic websites. We also release a base version of WuDaoMM with 5\nmillion strong-correlated image-text pairs, which is sufficient to support the\ncommon cross-modal model pre-training. Besides, we trained both an\nunderstanding and a generation vision-language (VL) model to test the dataset\neffectiveness. The results show that WuDaoMM can be applied as an efficient\ndataset for VLPMs, especially for the model in text-to-image generation task.\nThe data is released at https://data.wudaoai.cn",

For example,\nwhile synthetic captions often provide superior quality and image-text\nalignment, it is not clear whether they can fully replace AltTexts: the role of\nsynthetic captions and their interaction with original web-crawled AltTexts in\npre-training is still not well understood. Moreover, different multimodal\nfoundation models may have unique preferences for specific caption formats, but\nefforts to identify the optimal captions for each model remain limited. In this\nwork, we propose a novel, controllable, and scalable captioning pipeline\ndesigned to generate diverse caption formats tailored to various multimodal\nmodels. By examining Short Synthetic Captions (SSC) towards Dense Synthetic\nCaptions (DSC+) as case studies, we systematically explore their effects and\ninteractions with AltTexts across models such as CLIP, multimodal LLMs, and\ndiffusion models. Our findings reveal that a hybrid approach that keeps both\nsynthetic captions and AltTexts can outperform the use of synthetic captions\nalone, improving both alignment and performance, with each model demonstrating\npreferences for particular caption formats. This comprehensive analysis\nprovides valuable insights into optimizing captioning strategies, thereby\nadvancing the pre-training of multimodal foundation models.",

The surprising emergent\ncapabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math\nreasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential\npath to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and\nindustry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even better\nthan GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this\npaper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of\nall, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related\nconcepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as\nevaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended\nto support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue\nwith multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL\n(M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To\nconclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising\nresearch directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just\nbegun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.\nAn associated GitHub link collecting the latest papers is available at\nhttps://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models.",

Despite initial studies, a substantial\ngap remains between the interpretability of LLMs and MMFMs. This survey\nexplores two key aspects: (1) the adaptation of LLM interpretability methods to\nmultimodal models and (2) understanding the mechanistic differences between\nunimodal language models and crossmodal systems.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale\nIntegrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark\nunifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph\nmodalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01\nterabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and\nmultimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that\nmultitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied\ndomains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis\nover single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves\nmodels' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder\nperformance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with\ntask-appropriate fusion strategies.

Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multimodal conversational\nmodel, Insect-LLaVA, to promote visual understanding in insect-domain\nknowledge. In particular, we first introduce a new large-scale Multimodal\nInsect Dataset with Visual Insect Instruction Data that enables the capability\nof learning the multimodal foundation models.

Second, we propose a new Insect-LLaVA model, a new general Large\nLanguage and Vision Assistant in Visual Insect Understanding. Then, to enhance\nthe capability of learning insect features, we develop an Insect Foundation\nModel by introducing a new micro-feature self-supervised learning with a\nPatch-wise Relevant Attention mechanism to capture the subtle differences among\ninsect images. We also present Description Consistency loss to improve\nmicro-feature learning via text descriptions.

The machine-generated content is a double-edged\nsword. On one hand, it can benefit the society when used appropriately. On the\nother hand, it may mislead people, posing threats to the society, especially\nwhen mixed together with natural content created by humans. Hence, there is an\nurgent need to develop effective methods to detect machine-generated content.\nHowever, the lack of aligned multimodal datasets inhibited the development of\nsuch methods, particularly in triple-modality settings (e.g., text, image, and\nvoice). In this paper, we introduce RU-AI, a new large-scale multimodal dataset\nfor robust and effective detection of machine-generated content in text, image\nand voice. Our dataset is constructed on the basis of three large publicly\navailable datasets: Flickr8K, COCO and Places205, by adding their corresponding\nAI duplicates, resulting in a total of 1,475,370 instances. In addition, we\ncreated an additional noise variant of the dataset for testing the robustness\nof detection models. We conducted extensive experiments with the current SOTA\ndetection methods on our dataset. The results reveal that existing models still\nstruggle to achieve accurate and robust detection on our dataset. We hope that\nthis new data set can promote research in the field of machine-generated\ncontent detection, fostering the responsible use of generative AI.

To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied\napproach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to\nan optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

Given their potential use as (autonomous) decision-making agents, it is\nimportant to understand how these models perform such reinforcement learning\n(RL) tasks and the extent to which they are susceptible to biases. Motivated by\nthe fact that, in humans, it has been widely documented that the value of an\noutcome depends on how it compares to other local outcomes, the present study\nfocuses on whether similar value encoding biases apply to how LLMs encode\nrewarding outcomes. Results from experiments with multiple bandit tasks and\nmodels show that LLMs exhibit behavioral signatures of a relative value bias.\nAdding explicit outcome comparisons to the prompt produces opposing effects on\nperformance, enhancing maximization in trained choice sets but impairing\ngeneralization to new choice sets. Computational cognitive modeling reveals\nthat LLM behavior is well-described by a simple RL algorithm that incorporates\nrelative values at the outcome encoding stage. Lastly, we present preliminary\nevidence that the observed biases are not limited to fine-tuned LLMs, and that\nrelative value processing is detectable in the final hidden layer activations\nof a raw, pretrained model. These findings have important implications for the\nuse of LLMs in decision-making applications.",

            "abstract": "Self-correction is a highly desirable capability of large language models\n(LLMs), yet it has consistently been found to be largely ineffective in modern\nLLMs. Current methods for training self-correction typically depend on either\nmultiple models, a more advanced model, or additional forms of supervision. To\naddress these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's\nself-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we\nfirst show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline\nmodel-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling\nself-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT falls\nprey to either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the\ndata-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to behavior collapse,\nwhere learning implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior\nthat is often not effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe\naddresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of\nself-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer\nthe learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective\nat test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt.\nThis regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a\nbase model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to\ncollapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With\nGemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves\nstate-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models'\nself-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on MATH and HumanEval.",

However,\nexisting works have primarily focused on structured environments relying on\nmeticulously crafted representations of tasks, thereby limiting the agent's\nability to generalize skills across tasks. In this paper, we aim to enhance the\ngeneralization capabilities of agents in open-ended text-based learning\nenvironments by integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Large Language\nModels (LLMs). We investigate three types of agents: (i) RL-based agents that\nutilize natural language for state and action representations to find the best\ninteraction strategy, (ii) LLM-based agents that leverage the model's general\nknowledge and reasoning through prompting, and (iii) hybrid LLM-assisted RL\nagents that combine these two strategies to improve agents' performance and\ngeneralization. To support the development and evaluation of these agents, we\nintroduce PharmaSimText, a novel benchmark derived from the PharmaSim virtual\npharmacy environment designed for practicing diagnostic conversations. Our\nresults show that RL-based agents excel in task completion but lack in asking\nquality diagnostic questions. In contrast, LLM-based agents perform better in\nasking diagnostic questions but fall short of completing the task. Finally,\nhybrid LLM-assisted RL agents enable us to overcome these limitations,\nhighlighting the potential of combining RL and LLMs to develop high-performing\nagents for open-ended learning environments.",

Traditional crop management practices, often developed\nthrough empirical experience, face significant challenges in adapting to the\ndynamic nature of modern agriculture, which is influenced by factors such as\nclimate change, soil variability, and market conditions. Recently,\nreinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) bring\ntransformative potential, with RL providing adaptive methodologies to learn\noptimal strategies and LLMs offering vast, superhuman knowledge across\nagricultural domains, enabling informed, context-specific decision-making. This\npaper systematically examines how the integration of RL and LLMs into crop\nmanagement decision support systems (DSSs) can drive advancements in\nagricultural practice. We explore recent advancements in RL and LLM algorithms,\ntheir application within crop management, and the use of crop management\nsimulators to develop these technologies. The convergence of RL and LLMs with\ncrop management DSSs presents new opportunities to optimize agricultural\npractices through data-driven, adaptive solutions that can address the\nuncertainties and complexities of crop production. However, this integration\nalso brings challenges, particularly in real-world deployment. We discuss these\nchallenges and propose potential solutions, including the use of offline RL and\nenhanced LLM integration, to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of\ncrop management. Our findings emphasize the need for continued research and\ninnovation to unlock the full potential of these advanced tools in transforming\nagricultural systems into optimal and controllable ones.",

Despite the effectiveness in improving LLM capabilities, its\nimplementation remains highly complex, requiring complex algorithms, reward\nmodeling strategies, and optimization techniques. This complexity poses\nchallenges for researchers and practitioners in developing a systematic\nunderstanding of RL-enhanced LLMs. Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive\nsurvey summarizing existing research on RL-enhanced LLMs has limited progress\nin this domain, hindering further advancements.\n  In this work, we are going to make a systematic review of the most up-to-date\nstate of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze\nthe rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the\ncurrent challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of\nRL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two\nwidely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4)\nexplore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the\nreward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs\nwith human expectations. We will also point out current challenges and\ndeficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further\nimprovements.

However,\nexisting works have primarily focused on structured environments relying on\nmeticulously crafted representations of tasks, thereby limiting the agent's\nability to generalize skills across tasks. In this paper, we aim to enhance the\ngeneralization capabilities of agents in open-ended text-based learning\nenvironments by integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Large Language\nModels (LLMs). We investigate three types of agents: (i) RL-based agents that\nutilize natural language for state and action representations to find the best\ninteraction strategy, (ii) LLM-based agents that leverage the model's general\nknowledge and reasoning through prompting, and (iii) hybrid LLM-assisted RL\nagents that combine these two strategies to improve agents' performance and\ngeneralization. To support the development and evaluation of these agents, we\nintroduce PharmaSimText, a novel benchmark derived from the PharmaSim virtual\npharmacy environment designed for practicing diagnostic conversations. Our\nresults show that RL-based agents excel in task completion but lack in asking\nquality diagnostic questions. In contrast, LLM-based agents perform better in\nasking diagnostic questions but fall short of completing the task. Finally,\nhybrid LLM-assisted RL agents enable us to overcome these limitations,\nhighlighting the potential of combining RL and LLMs to develop high-performing\nagents for open-ended learning environments.",

Existing methods largely use closed-vocabulary\nobject lists to mitigate or evaluate hallucinations in image captioning,\nignoring the long-tailed nature of hallucinations that occur in practice. To\nthis end, we propose a framework for addressing hallucinations in image\ncaptioning in the open-vocabulary setting. Our framework includes a new\nbenchmark, OpenCHAIR, that leverages generative foundation models to evaluate\nopen-vocabulary object hallucinations for image captioning, surpassing the\npopular and similarly-sized CHAIR benchmark in both diversity and accuracy.\nFurthermore, to mitigate open-vocabulary hallucinations without using a closed\nobject list, we propose MOCHa, an approach harnessing advancements in\nreinforcement learning. Our multi-objective reward function explicitly targets\nthe trade-off between fidelity and adequacy in generations without requiring\nany strong supervision. MOCHa improves a large variety of image captioning\nmodels, as captured by our OpenCHAIR benchmark and other existing metrics.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages\nself-feedback as visual cues. Building on this approach, we introduce Volcano,\na multimodal self-feedback guided revision model. Volcano generates natural\nlanguage feedback to its initial response based on the provided visual\ninformation and utilizes this feedback to self-revise its initial response.\nVolcano effectively reduces multimodal hallucination and achieves\nstate-of-the-art on MMHal-Bench, POPE, and GAVIE. It also improves on general\nmultimodal abilities and outperforms previous models on MM-Vet and MMBench.\nThrough qualitative analysis, we show that Volcano's feedback is properly\ngrounded on the image than the initial response. This indicates that Volcano\ncan provide itself with richer visual information through feedback generation,\nleading to self-correct hallucinations.

While this issue is extensively researched in natural\nlanguage processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation\nof hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU),\nespecially in the context of image quality assessment tasks. We consider that\nthese hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the\nmodels. To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction\ndatabase, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations\nin low-level vision tasks. This database contains approximately 200K\nquestion-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types\nof instructions. Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure\nElimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region\nfeatures and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension\nabilities of the model in low-level vision tasks. Furthermore, we propose the\nEnhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase\nthe model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence\nof hallucination. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level\nvision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method\nsignificantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces\nhallucinations.

However, existing MLLMs prevalently suffer from serious\nhallucination problems, generating text that is not factually grounded in\nassociated images. The problem makes existing MLLMs untrustworthy and thus\nimpractical in real-world (especially high-stakes) applications. To address the\nchallenge, we present RLHF-V, which enhances MLLM trustworthiness via behavior\nalignment from fine-grained correctional human feedback. Specifically, RLHF-V\ncollects human preference in the form of segment-level corrections on\nhallucinations, and performs dense direct preference optimization over the\nhuman feedback. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks in both automatic\nand human evaluation show that, RLHF-V can enable substantially more\ntrustworthy MLLM behaviors with promising data and computation efficiency.\nRemarkably, using 1.4k annotated data samples, RLHF-V significantly reduces the\nhallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8%, outperforming the concurrent\nLLaVA-RLHF trained on 10k annotated data. The final model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness among open-source MLLMs, and\nshows better robustness than GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations aroused from\nover-generalization.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention\nas a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from\nconstructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in\nresponses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data\nconstruction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We\nidentify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the\nconstructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by\nthe presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference\npolicy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically\nsummarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address\nhallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment\n(OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct\nhallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised\nresponses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO\nachieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B:\n13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared\nto the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.

Despite these\npromising developments, MLLMs often generate outputs that are inconsistent with\nthe visual content, a challenge known as hallucination, which poses substantial\nobstacles to their practical deployment and raises concerns regarding their\nreliability in real-world applications. This problem has attracted increasing\nattention, prompting efforts to detect and mitigate such inaccuracies. We\nreview recent advances in identifying, evaluating, and mitigating these\nhallucinations, offering a detailed overview of the underlying causes,\nevaluation benchmarks, metrics, and strategies developed to address this issue.\nAdditionally, we analyze the current challenges and limitations, formulating\nopen questions that delineate potential pathways for future research. By\ndrawing the granular classification and landscapes of hallucination causes,\nevaluation benchmarks, and mitigation methods, this survey aims to deepen the\nunderstanding of hallucinations in MLLMs and inspire further advancements in\nthe field. Through our thorough and in-depth review, we contribute to the\nongoing dialogue on enhancing the robustness and reliability of MLLMs,\nproviding valuable insights and resources for researchers and practitioners\nalike.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages\nself-feedback as visual cues. Building on this approach, we introduce Volcano,\na multimodal self-feedback guided revision model. Volcano generates natural\nlanguage feedback to its initial response based on the provided visual\ninformation and utilizes this feedback to self-revise its initial response.\nVolcano effectively reduces multimodal hallucination and achieves\nstate-of-the-art on MMHal-Bench, POPE, and GAVIE. It also improves on general\nmultimodal abilities and outperforms previous models on MM-Vet and MMBench.\nThrough qualitative analysis, we show that Volcano's feedback is properly\ngrounded on the image than the initial response. This indicates that Volcano\ncan provide itself with richer visual information through feedback generation,\nleading to self-correct hallucinations.

These hallucinations present\nchallenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy.\nExisting hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external\nresources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete\ncoverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor\nscalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which\nare often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper\npresents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that\nleverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods,\nMetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both\nopen-source and closed-source LLMs. MetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if\nan LLM's response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will\nbe violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource\nhallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on\ntwo open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA\noutperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the\nfour LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin\nranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and\n0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score).

We carefully\nassess the efficacy of our approach on several competitive benchmark problems\nand show that it can identify the top-performing method using only 5-15% of the\ntypical resources -- resulting in 85-95% LLM cost savings.

These hallucinations present\nchallenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy.\nExisting hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external\nresources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete\ncoverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor\nscalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which\nare often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper\npresents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that\nleverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods,\nMetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both\nopen-source and closed-source LLMs. MetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if\nan LLM's response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will\nbe violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource\nhallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on\ntwo open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA\noutperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the\nfour LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin\nranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and\n0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score).

To address these limitations, we introduce Dynamic Intelligence\nAssessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic\nquestion templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as\nmathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The\naccompanying dataset, DIA-Bench, contains a diverse collection of challenge\ntemplates with mutable parameters presented in various formats, including text,\nPDFs, compiled binaries, visual puzzles, and CTF-style cybersecurity\nchallenges. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's\nreliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed\nthat even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in\nvarying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably,\nAPI models like GPT-4o often overestimated their mathematical capabilities,\nwhile ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better performance due to effective tool usage.\nIn self-assessment, OpenAI's o1-mini proved to have the best judgement on what\ntasks it should attempt to solve. We evaluated 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using\nDIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often\ndisplay unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions.

Firstly, LLMs sometimes generate\nanswers that rely on internal memory rather than retrieving evidence and\nreasoning in the given context, which brings concerns about the evaluation\nquality of real reasoning abilities. Although previous counterfactual QA\nbenchmarks can separate the internal memory of LLMs, they focus solely on final\nQA performance, which is insufficient for reporting LLMs' real reasoning\nabilities. Because LLMs are expected to engage in intricate reasoning processes\nthat involve evidence retrieval and answering a series of sub-questions from\ngiven passages. Moreover, current factual Multi-hop QA (MHQA) benchmarks are\nannotated on open-source corpora such as Wikipedia, although useful for\nmulti-step reasoning evaluation, they show limitations due to the potential\ndata contamination in LLMs' pre-training stage. To address these issues, we\nintroduce a Step-wise Counterfactual benchmark (CofCA), a novel evaluation\nbenchmark consisting of factual data and counterfactual data that reveals LLMs'\nreal reasoning abilities on multi-step reasoning and reasoning chain\nevaluation. Our experimental results reveal a significant performance gap of\nseveral LLMs between Wikipedia-based factual data and counterfactual data,\ndeeming data contamination issues in existing benchmarks.

However, current\nbenchmarks are often simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well and\nmaking it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks\ntypically rely on static question-answer pairs that the models might memorize\nor guess. To address these limitations, we introduce Dynamic Intelligence\nAssessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic\nquestion templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as\nmathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The\naccompanying dataset, DIA-Bench, contains a diverse collection of challenge\ntemplates with mutable parameters presented in various formats, including text,\nPDFs, compiled binaries, visual puzzles, and CTF-style cybersecurity\nchallenges. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's\nreliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed\nthat even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in\nvarying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably,\nAPI models like GPT-4o often overestimated their mathematical capabilities,\nwhile ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better performance due to effective tool usage.\nIn self-assessment, OpenAI's o1-mini proved to have the best judgement on what\ntasks it should attempt to solve. We evaluated 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using\nDIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often\ndisplay unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions.

            "abstract": "Most video captioning models are designed to process short video clips of few\nseconds and output text describing low-level visual concepts (e.g., objects,\nscenes, atomic actions). However, most real-world videos last for minutes or\nhours and have a complex hierarchical structure spanning different temporal\ngranularities. We propose Video ReCap, a recursive video captioning model that\ncan process video inputs of dramatically different lengths (from 1 second to 2\nhours) and output video captions at multiple hierarchy levels. The recursive\nvideo-language architecture exploits the synergy between different video\nhierarchies and can process hour-long videos efficiently. We utilize a\ncurriculum learning training scheme to learn the hierarchical structure of\nvideos, starting from clip-level captions describing atomic actions, then\nfocusing on segment-level descriptions, and concluding with generating\nsummaries for hour-long videos. Furthermore, we introduce Ego4D-HCap dataset by\naugmenting Ego4D with 8,267 manually collected long-range video summaries. Our\nrecursive model can flexibly generate captions at different hierarchy levels\nwhile also being useful for other complex video understanding tasks, such as\nVideoQA on EgoSchema.

However, as the length\nof the video increases, generating long, detailed captions becomes a\nsignificant challenge. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of LMMs in\ngenerating long captions for long videos. Our analysis reveals that open-source\nLMMs struggle to consistently produce outputs exceeding 300 words, leading to\nincomplete or overly concise descriptions of the visual content. This\nlimitation hinders the ability of LMMs to provide comprehensive and detailed\ncaptions for long videos, ultimately missing important visual information.\nThrough controlled experiments, we find that the scarcity of paired examples\nwith long-captions during training is the primary factor limiting the model's\noutput length. However, manually annotating long-caption examples for long-form\nvideos is time-consuming and expensive. To overcome the annotation bottleneck,\nwe propose the LongCaption-Agent, a framework that synthesizes long caption\ndata by hierarchical semantic aggregation. % aggregating multi-level\ndescriptions. Using LongCaption-Agent, we curated a new long-caption dataset,\nLongCaption-10K. We also develop LongCaption-Bench, a benchmark designed to\ncomprehensively evaluate the quality of long captions generated by LMMs. By\nincorporating LongCaption-10K into training, we enable LMMs to generate\ncaptions exceeding 1,000 words for long-form videos, while maintaining high\noutput quality. In LongCaption-Bench, our model achieved State-of-The-Art\nperformance, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT4o.",

The increased number of frames in long videos poses two\nmain challenges: difficulty in locating key information and performing\nlong-range reasoning. Thus, we propose DrVideo, a document-retrieval-based\nsystem designed for long video understanding. Our key idea is to convert the\nlong-video understanding problem into a long-document understanding task so as\nto effectively leverage the power of large language models. Specifically,\nDrVideo first transforms a long video into a coarse text-based long document to\ninitially retrieve key frames and then updates the documents with the augmented\nkey frame information. It then employs an agent-based iterative loop to\ncontinuously search for missing information and augment the document until\nsufficient question-related information is gathered for making the final\npredictions in a chain-of-thought manner. Extensive experiments on long video\nbenchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method. DrVideo significantly\noutperforms existing LLM-based state-of-the-art methods on EgoSchema benchmark\n(3 minutes), MovieChat-1K benchmark (10 minutes), and the long split of\nVideo-MME benchmark (average of 44 minutes).",

However, the emphasis on brief summary texts\nduring pre-training prevents CLIP from understanding long descriptions. This\nissue is particularly acute regarding videos given that videos often contain\nabundant detailed contents. In this paper, we propose the VideoCLIP-XL (eXtra\nLength) model, which aims to unleash the long-description understanding\ncapability of video CLIP models. Firstly, we establish an automatic data\ncollection system and gather a large-scale VILD pre-training dataset with VIdeo\nand Long-Description pairs. Then, we propose Text-similarity-guided Primary\nComponent Matching (TPCM) to better learn the distribution of feature space\nwhile expanding the long description capability. We also introduce two new\ntasks namely Detail-aware Description Ranking (DDR) and Hallucination-aware\nDescription Ranking (HDR) for further understanding improvement. Finally, we\nconstruct a Long Video Description Ranking (LVDR) benchmark for evaluating the\nlong-description capability more comprehensively. Extensive experimental\nresults on widely-used text-video retrieval benchmarks with both short and long\ndescriptions and our LVDR benchmark can fully demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method.",

In this work, we introduce Tarsier, a family of\nlarge-scale video-language models designed to generate high-quality video\ndescriptions. Tarsier employs CLIP-ViT to encode frames separately and then\nuses an LLM to model temporal relationships. Despite its simple architecture,\nwe demonstrate that with a meticulously designed two-stage training procedure,\nthe Tarsier models exhibit substantially stronger video description\ncapabilities than any existing open-source model, showing a $+51.4\\%$ advantage\nin human side-by-side evaluation over the strongest model. Additionally, they\nare comparable to state-of-the-art proprietary models, with a $+12.3\\%$\nadvantage against GPT-4V and a $-6.7\\%$ disadvantage against Gemini 1.5 Pro.\nWhen upgraded to Tarsier2 by building upon SigLIP and Qwen2-7B, it further\nimproves significantly with a $+4.8\\%$ advantage against GPT-4o. Besides video\ndescription, Tarsier proves to be a versatile generalist model, achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results across nine public benchmarks, including multi-choice\nVQA, open-ended VQA, and zero-shot video captioning. Our second contribution is\nthe introduction of a new benchmark -- DREAM-1K\n(https://tarsier-vlm.github.io/) for evaluating video description models,\nconsisting of a new challenging dataset featuring videos from diverse sources\nand varying complexity, along with an automatic method specifically designed to\nassess the quality of fine-grained video descriptions.

Recent advances by proprietary\ncompanies, such as o-series models of OpenAI, have made remarkable progress on\nreasoning tasks. However, the complete technical details remain unrevealed, and\nthe techniques that are believed certainly to be adopted are only reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and the long chain of thoughts. This paper proposes a new RL\nframework, termed OREAL, to pursue the performance limit that can be achieved\nthrough \\textbf{O}utcome \\textbf{RE}w\\textbf{A}rd-based reinforcement\n\\textbf{L}earning for mathematical reasoning tasks, where only binary outcome\nrewards are easily accessible. We theoretically prove that behavior cloning on\npositive trajectories from best-of-N (BoN) sampling is sufficient to learn the\nKL-regularized optimal policy in binary feedback environments. This formulation\nfurther implies that the rewards of negative samples should be reshaped to\nensure the gradient consistency between positive and negative samples. To\nalleviate the long-existing difficulties brought by sparse rewards in RL, which\nare even exacerbated by the partial correctness of the long chain of thought\nfor reasoning tasks, we further apply a token-level reward model to sample\nimportant tokens in reasoning trajectories for learning. With OREAL, for the\nfirst time, a 7B model can obtain 94.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500 through RL,\nbeing on par with 32B models. OREAL-32B also surpasses previous 32B models\ntrained by distillation with 95.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500. Our\ninvestigation also indicates the importance of initial policy models and\ntraining queries for RL. Code, models, and data will be released to benefit\nfuture research\\footnote{https://github.com/InternLM/OREAL}.",

However, RLHF is susceptible to\nreward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather\nthan learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward\nshaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a\nsystematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying\nprinciples remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive\nstudy of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key\ndesign principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid\ninitial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best\nformulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we\npropose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent\npreferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for\nreinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and\nLlama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF.\nExperimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward\nshaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at\nleast 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches.

While reward\nshaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a\nsystematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying\nprinciples remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive\nstudy of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key\ndesign principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid\ninitial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best\nformulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we\npropose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent\npreferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for\nreinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and\nLlama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF.\nExperimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward\nshaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at\nleast 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR\nexhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward\nfor optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even\nafter two full epochs of training.

Traditional multi-agent path planning\nalgorithms struggle to achieve efficient distributed path planning for multiple\nagents. In contrast, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has been\ndemonstrated as an effective approach to achieve this objective. By modeling\nthe MAPF problem as a MARL problem, agents can achieve efficient path planning\nand collision avoidance through distributed strategies under partial\nobservation. However, MARL strategies often lack cooperation among agents due\nto the absence of global information, which subsequently leads to reduced MAPF\nefficiency. To address this challenge, this letter introduces a unique reward\nshaping technique based on Independent Q-Learning (IQL). The aim of this method\nis to evaluate the influence of one agent on its neighbors and integrate such\nan interaction into the reward function, leading to active cooperation among\nagents. This reward shaping method facilitates cooperation among agents while\noperating in a distributed manner. The proposed approach has been evaluated\nthrough experiments across various scenarios with different scales and agent\ncounts. The results are compared with those from other state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nplanners. The evidence suggests that the approach proposed in this letter\nparallels other planners in numerous aspects, and outperforms them in scenarios\nfeaturing a large number of agents.",

This paper explores the zero-shot abilities\nof recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of\nliterature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two\ncomponents: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing\na literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective\nLLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step\nsearch strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the\nabstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying\nan external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking\nmechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized\nrecall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the\nLLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step\napproach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in\nthe plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based\nliterature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a\nprotocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set\ncontamination in zero-shot evaluations.

Previous work on\nLLM-based relevance assessment has primarily focused on replicating graded\nhuman relevance judgments through various prompting strategies. However, there\nhas been limited exploration of alternative assessment methods or comprehensive\ncomparative studies. In this paper, we systematically compare multiple\nLLM-based relevance assessment methods, including binary relevance judgments,\ngraded relevance assessments, pairwise preference-based methods, and two\nnugget-based evaluation methods~--~document-agnostic and document-dependent. In\naddition to a traditional comparison based on system rankings using Kendall\ncorrelations, we also examine how well LLM judgments align with human\npreferences, as inferred from relevance grades. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on datasets from three TREC Deep Learning tracks 2019, 2020 and\n2021 as well as the ANTIQUE dataset, which focuses on non-factoid open-domain\nquestion answering. As part of our data release, we include relevance judgments\ngenerated by both an open-source (Llama3.2b) and a commercial (gpt-4o) model.\nOur goal is to \\textit{reproduce} various LLM-based relevance judgment methods\nto provide a comprehensive comparison.

First, we analyze how learning\ncan enhance search efficiency and propose Search via Learning (SeaL), a\nframework that leverages LLMs for effective and efficient search. Second, we\nfurther extend SeaL to SeaL-C to ensure rigorous completeness during search.\nOur evaluation across three real-world planning tasks demonstrates that SeaL\nachieves near-perfect accuracy while reducing search spaces by up to 99.1%\ncompared to traditional approaches. Finally, we explore how far LLMs are from\nreal search by investigating whether they can develop search capabilities\nindependently. Our analysis reveals that while current LLMs struggle with\nefficient search in complex problems, incorporating systematic search\nstrategies significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities. These\nfindings not only validate the effectiveness of our approach but also highlight\nthe need for improving LLMs' search abilities for real-world applications.",

With the\nemergence of LLM-based chatbots, students are increasingly turning to these\ntools as their primary resource for acquiring knowledge.

They worry that these fully-automated LLMs might lead\nstudents to delegate critical steps of search as learning. In this paper, we\nsystematically uncover three main concerns from educators' perspectives. In\nresponse to these concerns, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 92\nuniversity students to compare three learning sources with different automation\nlevels. Our results show that LLMs support comprehensive understanding of key\nconcepts without promoting passive learning, though their effectiveness in\nknowledge retention was limited.

Concretely, a Query-Instructed Adapter (QIA) module is\ndesigned to derive the user/item representation vectors by incorporating their\nheterogeneous features. A feature adaptation step is further introduced to\nalign the semantics of user/item representations with the LLM.

            "abstract": "Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a\nsearcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems. The best way to\ncapture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback\non which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a\nlarge number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with\nthird-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of\nlow-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve\nquality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user\nstudies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically\ndisagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging\nguidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate\napproach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real\nusers, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that\ncan be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with\nthat data.\n  We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for\nlarge-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We\nhave found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as\nhuman labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs,\nand best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in\naccuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real\nsearchers needs high-quality \"gold\" labels, but with these we find that models\nproduce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and\nthese labels let us train notably better rankers.",

Recently, an additional post-ranking\nstage is suggested in SE to enhance user satisfaction in practical\napplications. Nevertheless, research dedicated to enhancing the post-ranking\nstage through LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce a\nnovel paradigm named Large Language Models for Post-Ranking in search engine\n(LLM4PR), which leverages the capabilities of LLMs to accomplish the\npost-ranking task in SE. Concretely, a Query-Instructed Adapter (QIA) module is\ndesigned to derive the user/item representation vectors by incorporating their\nheterogeneous features. A feature adaptation step is further introduced to\nalign the semantics of user/item representations with the LLM. Finally, the\nLLM4PR integrates a learning to post-rank step, leveraging both a main task and\nan auxiliary task to fine-tune the model to adapt the post-ranking task.\nExperiment studies demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to significant\nimprovements and exhibits state-of-the-art performance compared with other\nalternatives.",

For Search4LLM, we investigate how search engines can provide\ndiverse high-quality datasets for pre-training of LLMs, how they can use the\nmost relevant documents to help LLMs learn to answer queries more accurately,\nhow training LLMs with Learning-To-Rank (LTR) tasks can enhance their ability\nto respond with greater precision, and how incorporating recent search results\ncan make LLM-generated content more accurate and current. In terms of\nLLM4Search, we examine how LLMs can be used to summarize content for better\nindexing by search engines, improve query outcomes through optimization,\nenhance the ranking of search results by analyzing document relevance, and help\nin annotating data for learning-to-rank tasks in various learning contexts.\nHowever, this promising integration comes with its challenges, which include\naddressing potential biases and ethical issues in training models, managing the\ncomputational and other costs of incorporating LLMs into search services, and\ncontinuously updating LLM training with the ever-changing web content.

(2022)) predict training loss from a static compute budget yet\nneglect time and efficiency, prompting the question: how can we balance\nballooning GPU fleets with rapidly improving hardware and algorithms? We\nintroduce the relative-loss equation, a time- and efficiency-aware framework\nthat extends classical AI scaling laws. Our model shows that, without ongoing\nefficiency gains, advanced performance could demand millennia of training or\nunrealistically large GPU fleets. However, near-exponential progress remains\nachievable if the \"efficiency-doubling rate\" parallels Moore's Law. By\nformalizing this race to efficiency, we offer a quantitative roadmap for\nbalancing front-loaded GPU investments with incremental improvements across the\nAI stack. Empirical trends suggest that sustained efficiency gains can push AI\nscaling well into the coming decade, providing a new perspective on the\ndiminishing returns inherent in classical scaling.",

To address this, we propose a new\nscaling law that predicts optimal hyperparameters for any model size and\ncompute budget. Under these optimal settings, we achieve comparable performance\nand reduce inference costs by 40.1% compared to conventional scaling methods,\nwithin a compute budget of 1e10 TFlops. Furthermore, we establish a more\ngeneralized and precise relationship among validation loss, any model size, and\ncompute budget.

Through experimental analysis, we\ndiscovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law\nrelationship with the amount of training data; (2) a small increase in the\nquantity of long-tailed data can significantly improve the performance for the\ncorresponding scenarios; (3) appropriate scaling of data enables the model to\nachieve combinatorial generalization in novel scenes and actions. Our results\nhighlight the critical role of data scaling in improving the generalizability\nof models across diverse autonomous driving scenarios, assuring safe deployment\nin the real world.

To address this, we propose a new\nscaling law that predicts optimal hyperparameters for any model size and\ncompute budget. Under these optimal settings, we achieve comparable performance\nand reduce inference costs by 40.1% compared to conventional scaling methods,\nwithin a compute budget of 1e10 TFlops. Furthermore, we establish a more\ngeneralized and precise relationship among validation loss, any model size, and\ncompute budget.

Although the Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) architecture has been employed to efficiently scale large language and\nimage-text models, these efforts typically involve fewer experts and limited\nmodalities. To address this, our work presents the pioneering attempt to\ndevelop a unified MLLM with the MoE architecture, named Uni-MoE that can handle\na wide array of modalities. Specifically, it features modality-specific\nencoders with connectors for a unified multimodal representation. We also\nimplement a sparse MoE architecture within the LLMs to enable efficient\ntraining and inference through modality-level data parallelism and expert-level\nmodel parallelism. To enhance the multi-expert collaboration and\ngeneralization, we present a progressive training strategy: 1) Cross-modality\nalignment using various connectors with different cross-modality data, 2)\nTraining modality-specific experts with cross-modality instruction data to\nactivate experts' preferences, and 3) Tuning the Uni-MoE framework utilizing\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on mixed multimodal instruction data. We evaluate\nthe instruction-tuned Uni-MoE on a comprehensive set of multimodal datasets.\nThe extensive experimental results demonstrate Uni-MoE's principal advantage of\nsignificantly reducing performance bias in handling mixed multimodal datasets,\nalongside improved multi-expert collaboration and generalization.

Distinct from recent survey papers\nthat present general information on multimodal architectures, this research\nconducts a comprehensive exploration of architectural details and identifies\nfour specific architectural types. The types are distinguished by their\nrespective methodologies for integrating multimodal inputs into the deep neural\nnetwork model. The first two types (Type A and B) deeply fuses multimodal\ninputs within the internal layers of the model, whereas the following two types\n(Type C and D) facilitate early fusion at the input stage. Type-A employs\nstandard cross-attention, whereas Type-B utilizes custom-designed layers for\nmodality fusion within the internal layers. On the other hand, Type-C utilizes\nmodality-specific encoders, while Type-D leverages tokenizers to process the\nmodalities at the model's input stage. The identified architecture types aid\nthe monitoring of any-to-any multimodal model development. Notably, Type-C and\nType-D are currently favored in the construction of any-to-any multimodal\nmodels. Type-C, distinguished by its non-tokenizing multimodal model\narchitecture, is emerging as a viable alternative to Type-D, which utilizes\ninput-tokenizing techniques.

However, existing scaling\nmethods enable all model parameters to be active for each token in the\ncalculation, which brings massive training and inferring costs. In this work,\nwe propose a simple yet effective training strategy MoE-Tuning for LVLMs. This\nstrategy innovatively addresses the common issue of performance degradation in\nmulti-modal sparsity learning, consequently constructing a sparse model with an\noutrageous number of parameters but a constant computational cost. Furthermore,\nwe present the MoE-LLaVA, a MoE-based sparse LVLM architecture, which uniquely\nactivates only the top-k experts through routers during deployment, keeping the\nremaining experts inactive. Extensive experiments show the significant\nperformance of MoE-LLaVA in a variety of visual understanding and object\nhallucination benchmarks. Remarkably, with only approximately 3B sparsely\nactivated parameters, MoE-LLaVA demonstrates performance comparable to the\nLLaVA-1.5-7B on various visual understanding datasets and even surpasses the\nLLaVA-1.5-13B in object hallucination benchmark.

Although the Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) architecture has been employed to efficiently scale large language and\nimage-text models, these efforts typically involve fewer experts and limited\nmodalities. To address this, our work presents the pioneering attempt to\ndevelop a unified MLLM with the MoE architecture, named Uni-MoE that can handle\na wide array of modalities. Specifically, it features modality-specific\nencoders with connectors for a unified multimodal representation. We also\nimplement a sparse MoE architecture within the LLMs to enable efficient\ntraining and inference through modality-level data parallelism and expert-level\nmodel parallelism. To enhance the multi-expert collaboration and\ngeneralization, we present a progressive training strategy: 1) Cross-modality\nalignment using various connectors with different cross-modality data, 2)\nTraining modality-specific experts with cross-modality instruction data to\nactivate experts' preferences, and 3) Tuning the Uni-MoE framework utilizing\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on mixed multimodal instruction data. We evaluate\nthe instruction-tuned Uni-MoE on a comprehensive set of multimodal datasets.\nThe extensive experimental results demonstrate Uni-MoE's principal advantage of\nsignificantly reducing performance bias in handling mixed multimodal datasets,\nalongside improved multi-expert collaboration and generalization.

The transformer\nhas been used as a replacement for the widely used convolution operators, due\nto its ability to learn long-range dependencies. This replacement was proven to\nbe successful in numerous tasks, in which several state-of-the-art methods rely\non transformers for better learning. In computer vision, the 3D field has also\nwitnessed an increase in employing the transformer for 3D convolution neural\nnetworks and multi-layer perceptron networks. Although a number of surveys have\nfocused on transformers in vision in general, 3D vision requires special\nattention due to the difference in data representation and processing when\ncompared to 2D vision. In this work, we present a systematic and thorough\nreview of more than 100 transformers methods for different 3D vision tasks,\nincluding classification, segmentation, detection, completion, pose estimation,\nand others. We discuss transformer design in 3D vision, which allows it to\nprocess data with various 3D representations. For each application, we\nhighlight key properties and contributions of proposed transformer-based\nmethods. To assess the competitiveness of these methods, we compare their\nperformance to common non-transformer methods on 12 3D benchmarks.

This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to\naddress this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in\npretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D\nwindows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA\neliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise\nsliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel\nhardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being\nhardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the\nfirst efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving\n58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over\nFlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3).

To mitigate the excessive influence of\nreference image features and textual guidance on generated video content during\ninference, we implement the Time-Aware Reference Attention Bias (TAB) strategy,\ndynamically modulating reference bias over different time steps. Additionally,\nwe introduce the Entity Region-Aware Enhancement (ERAE) module, aligning highly\nactivated regions of key entity tokens with reference feature injection by\nadjusting attention bias. To thoroughly evaluate personalized video generation,\nwe establish a new benchmark, VideoBench, comprising over 50 objects and 100\nprompts for extensive assessment.

Building upon this premise, this paper\ncritically examines the role and efficacy of self-correction within LLMs,\nshedding light on its true potential and limitations. Central to our\ninvestigation is the notion of intrinsic self-correction, whereby an LLM\nattempts to correct its initial responses based solely on its inherent\ncapabilities, without the crutch of external feedback. In the context of\nreasoning, our research indicates that LLMs struggle to self-correct their\nresponses without external feedback, and at times, their performance even\ndegrades after self-correction.

Overlooking this factor may cause the models to\nover-criticize themselves, resulting in unreliable conclusions regarding the\nefficacy of self-correction. We have experimentally observed that LLMs possess\nthe capability to understand the \"confidence\" in their own responses. It\nmotivates us to develop an \"If-or-Else\" (IoE) prompting framework, designed to\nguide LLMs in assessing their own \"confidence\", facilitating intrinsic\nself-corrections. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our\nIoE-based Prompt can achieve a consistent improvement regarding the accuracy of\nself-corrected responses over the initial answers. Our study not only sheds\nlight on the underlying factors affecting self-correction in LLMs, but also\nintroduces a practical framework that utilizes the IoE prompting principle to\nefficiently improve self-correction capabilities with \"confidence\".

Previous studies have mainly concentrated on\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs,\nparticularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely\nunexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs\nduring both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction\nLearning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated\nself-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without\nrelying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we\ncollect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial\nand refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs\nduring the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs\nstruggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without\nadditional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their\nperformance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when\ntheir self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and\ndisfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a\nrefinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models\nthrough additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses\ndirectly without further refinement.",

In this paper, we show that poor self-correction performance stems\nfrom LLMs' inability to find logical mistakes, rather than their ability to\ncorrect a known mistake. Firstly, we benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on\ntheir mistake-finding ability and demonstrate that they generally struggle with\nthe task, even in highly objective, unambiguous cases. Secondly, we test the\ncorrection abilities of LLMs -- separately from mistake finding -- using a\nbacktracking setup that feeds ground truth mistake location information to the\nmodel. We show that this boosts downstream task performance across our 5\nreasoning tasks, indicating that LLMs' correction abilities are robust.\nFinally, we show that it is possible to obtain mistake location information\nwithout ground truth labels or in-domain training data. We train a small\nclassifier with out-of-domain data, which exhibits stronger mistake-finding\nperformance than prompting a large model.

While many approaches exist for self-reflection\nat inference time, we propose a novel method that combines ideas from negative\nsampling, self-reflection during training, and inference time. InSeC allows\nLLMs to correct themselves by introducing mistakes and their corresponding\ncorrections during training, thereby converting the learning process into a\ntrue supervised learning task with both positive and negative examples.

Such discrepancies can make\nLLMs interpret seemingly unambiguous questions in unexpected ways, yielding\nincorrect responses. While it is widely acknowledged that the quality of a\nprompt, such as a question, significantly impacts the quality of the response\nprovided by LLMs, a systematic method for crafting questions that LLMs can\nbetter comprehend is still underdeveloped. In this paper, we present a method\nnamed `Rephrase and Respond' (RaR), which allows LLMs to rephrase and expand\nquestions posed by humans and provide responses in a single prompt. This\napproach serves as a simple yet effective prompting method for improving\nperformance. We also introduce a two-step variant of RaR, where a rephrasing\nLLM first rephrases the question and then passes the original and rephrased\nquestions together to a different responding LLM. This facilitates the\neffective utilization of rephrased questions generated by one LLM with another.\nOur experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the\nperformance of different models across a wide range to tasks. We further\nprovide a comprehensive comparison between RaR and the popular Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) methods, both theoretically and empirically. We show that RaR is\ncomplementary to CoT and can be combined with CoT to achieve even better\nperformance. Our work not only contributes to enhancing LLM performance\nefficiently and effectively but also sheds light on a fair evaluation of LLM\ncapabilities.

However, unlike the well-established performance\nimprovements achieved through scaling data and model size, the scaling of\nreasoning in LLMs is more complex and can even negatively impact reasoning\nperformance, introducing new challenges in model alignment and robustness. In\nthis survey, we provide a comprehensive examination of scaling in LLM\nreasoning, categorizing it into multiple dimensions and analyzing how and to\nwhat extent different scaling strategies contribute to improving reasoning\ncapabilities. We begin by exploring scaling in input size, which enables LLMs\nto process and utilize more extensive context for improved reasoning. Next, we\nanalyze scaling in reasoning steps that improves multi-step inference and\nlogical consistency. We then examine scaling in reasoning rounds, where\niterative interactions refine reasoning outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss\nscaling in training-enabled reasoning, focusing on optimization through\niterative model improvement. Finally, we review applications of scaling across\ndomains and outline future directions for further advancing LLM reasoning. By\nsynthesizing these diverse perspectives, this survey aims to provide insights\ninto how scaling strategies fundamentally enhance the reasoning capabilities of\nLLMs and further guide the development of next-generation AI systems.",

In this paper, we investigate a fundamental question: is moral\nself-correction an innate capability in LLMs? To explore this, we conduct (1) a\nmechanistic analysis of how key components of self-correction, such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and external feedback, interact to enable\nmoral self-correction; and (2) a behavioral analysis of LLMs' ability to\ndistinguish between desired and undesired outputs, introducing a\nself-distinguish framework. Our mechanistic analysis reveals that LLMs struggle\nto effectively leverage helpful feedback, and conflicts can arise between\nfeedback and CoT reasoning. These limitations suggest that LLMs fail to\nidentify useful contextual information, instead prioritizing their own internal\nknowledge. Additionally, our behavioral analysis indicates that LLMs struggle\nto differentiate among their own outputs. Based on these empirical findings\nacross two analytical dimensions, mechanism and behavior, we argue that moral\nself-correction is not an innate capability of LLMs.",

In this paper, we\nconduct an in-depth analysis of LLM parsing capabilities, delving into the\nspecific shortcomings of their parsing results. We find that LLMs may stem from\nlimitations to fully leverage grammar rules in existing treebanks, which\nrestricts their capability to generate valid syntactic structures. To help LLMs\nacquire knowledge without additional training, we propose a self-correction\nmethod that leverages grammar rules from existing treebanks to guide LLMs in\ncorrecting previous errors. Specifically, we automatically detect potential\nerrors and dynamically search for relevant rules, offering hints and examples\nto guide LLMs in making corrections themselves.

When instructions\nprovide only the task's goal without specific details about potential issues in\nthe response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to improve response\nquality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction. The empirical\nsuccess of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various applications, but\nhow and why it is effective remains unknown. In this paper, we unveil that\nintrinsic self-correction can be progressively improved, allowing it to\napproach a converged state. Our findings are verified in: (1) the scenario of\nmulti-round question answering, by comprehensively demonstrating that intrinsic\nself-correction can progressively introduce performance gains through iterative\ninteractions, ultimately converging to stable performance; and (2) the context\nof intrinsic self-correction for enhanced morality, in which we provide\nempirical evidence that iteratively applying instructions reduces model\nuncertainty towards convergence, which then leads to convergence of both the\ncalibration error and self-correction performance, ultimately resulting in a\nstable state of intrinsic self-correction. Furthermore, we introduce a\nmathematical formulation and a simulation task indicating that the latent\nconcepts activated by self-correction instructions drive the reduction of model\nuncertainty. Based on our experimental results and analysis of the convergence\nof intrinsic self-correction, we reveal its underlying mechanism: consistent\ninjected instructions reduce model uncertainty which yields converged, improved\nperformance.",

In this survey\npaper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin\nwith a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review\nwhat ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the\nincorporation of LLM technology.

While large language models (LLMs) are\npowerful tools for condensing large amounts of text, current interfaces to\nthese models lack support for understanding and controlling what content is\nincluded in a detailed summarizing article. Such capability is especially\nimportant for detail- and technical-oriented domains, in which tactical\nselection and coherent synthesis of key details is critical for effective\ncommunication to the target audience. For this, we present interactive reverse\nsource outlines, a novel mechanism for controllable long-form summarization\nfeaturing outline bullet points with automatic point selections that the user\ncan iteratively adjust to obtain an article with the desired content coverage.\nWe implement this mechanism in Papers-to-Posts, a new LLM-powered system for\nauthoring research-paper blog posts. Through a within-subjects lab study (n=20)\nand a between-subjects deployment study (n=37 blog posts, 26 participants), we\ncompare Papers-to-Posts to a strong baseline tool that provides an\nLLM-generated draft and access to free-form prompting. Under time constraints,\nPapers-to-Posts significantly increases writer satisfaction with blog post\nquality, particularly with respect to content coverage. Furthermore,\nquantitative results showed an increase in editing power (change in text for an\namount of time or writing actions) while using Papers-to-Posts, and qualitative\nresults showed that participants found incorporating key research-paper\ninsights in their blog posts easier while using Papers-to-Posts.",

Meta-analysis is a robust\nstatistical method that synthesizes the findings of multiple studies support\narticles to provide a comprehensive understanding. We know that a meta-article\nprovides a structured analysis of several articles. However, conducting\nmeta-analysis by hand is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to\nhuman error, highlighting the need for automated pipelines to streamline the\nprocess. Our research introduces a novel approach that fine-tunes the LLM on\nextensive scientific datasets to address challenges in big data handling and\nstructured data extraction. We automate and optimize the meta-analysis process\nby integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Tailored through prompt\nengineering and a new loss metric, Inverse Cosine Distance (ICD), designed for\nfine-tuning on large contextual datasets, LLMs efficiently generate structured\nmeta-analysis content. Human evaluation then assesses relevance and provides\ninformation on model performance in key metrics. This research demonstrates\nthat fine-tuned models outperform non-fine-tuned models, with fine-tuned LLMs\ngenerating 87.6% relevant meta-analysis abstracts. The relevance of the\ncontext, based on human evaluation, shows a reduction in irrelevancy from 4.56%\nto 1.9%.

We conduct comprehensive experiments with source news\narticles and find that (1) summarization models trained under the\nLLM-as-reference setting achieve significant performance improvement in both\nLLM and human evaluations; (2) contrastive learning outperforms standard\nsupervised fine-tuning under both low and high resource settings. Our\nexperimental results also enable a meta-analysis of LLMs' summary evaluation\ncapacities under a challenging setting, showing that LLMs are not well-aligned\nwith human evaluators. Particularly, our expert human evaluation reveals\nremaining nuanced performance gaps between LLMs and our fine-tuned models,\nwhich LLMs fail to capture.

Among them, academia is not simply a domain\naffected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs.\nIn academic publications, this phenomenon is represented during the\nincorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts.\nWe proposed the concept of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) in our\nprevious paper. As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase\nof ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold\ntransformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they\nalso pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey\npaper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin\nwith a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review\nwhat ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the\nincorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods,\nnew datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for\nASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and\ninvestigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR.\nLastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for\nASPR. We hope this survey can serve as an inspirational reference for the\nresearchers and promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.",

With the\nadvancement of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), the ability to\ncode stands out as one important measure to the model's reasoning performance.\nUsually, a two-stage training paradigm is implemented to obtain a Code LLM,\nnamely the pretraining and the fine-tuning. Within the fine-tuning, supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) are often used to improve\nthe model's zero-shot ability. A large number of work has been conducted to\nimprove the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either\nmodifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still\nlack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what\nkind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon\nthe SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand\nthe correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually\ncraft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a\nsynthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic\nfunctions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train\nand test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through\ncomprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions\nare indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic\nfunctions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target\ndomain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3)\nTraining RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the\nSFT phase.",

Motivated by\nthe fact that, in humans, it has been widely documented that the value of an\noutcome depends on how it compares to other local outcomes, the present study\nfocuses on whether similar value encoding biases apply to how LLMs encode\nrewarding outcomes. Results from experiments with multiple bandit tasks and\nmodels show that LLMs exhibit behavioral signatures of a relative value bias.\nAdding explicit outcome comparisons to the prompt produces opposing effects on\nperformance, enhancing maximization in trained choice sets but impairing\ngeneralization to new choice sets. Computational cognitive modeling reveals\nthat LLM behavior is well-described by a simple RL algorithm that incorporates\nrelative values at the outcome encoding stage. Lastly, we present preliminary\nevidence that the observed biases are not limited to fine-tuned LLMs, and that\nrelative value processing is detectable in the final hidden layer activations\nof a raw, pretrained model.

We utilize LLMs in\nmulti-role debates to create a dataset that includes both high-bias and\nlow-bias instances for training the reward model in reinforcement learning. Our\napproach comprises two modes: (1) self-reflection, where the same LLM\nparticipates in multi-role debates, and (2) teacher-student, where a more\nadvanced LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo guides the LLM to perform this task.\nExperimental results across different LLMs on BBQ and our datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach in bias mitigation.

There are several distinct approaches for preference\nfine-tuning, including supervised learning, on-policy reinforcement learning\n(RL), and contrastive learning. Different methods come with different\nimplementation tradeoffs and performance differences, and existing empirical\nfindings present different conclusions, for instance, some results show that\nonline RL is quite important to attain good fine-tuning results, while others\nfind (offline) contrastive or even purely supervised methods sufficient. This\nraises a natural question: what kind of approaches are important for\nfine-tuning with preference data and why? In this paper, we answer this\nquestion by performing a rigorous analysis of a number of fine-tuning\ntechniques on didactic and full-scale LLM problems. Our main finding is that,\nin general, approaches that use on-policy sampling or attempt to push down the\nlikelihood on certain responses (i.e., employ a \"negative gradient\") outperform\noffline and maximum likelihood objectives. We conceptualize our insights and\nunify methods that use on-policy sampling or negative gradient under a notion\nof mode-seeking objectives for categorical distributions. Mode-seeking\nobjectives are able to alter probability mass on specific bins of a categorical\ndistribution at a fast rate compared to maximum likelihood, allowing them to\nrelocate masses across bins more effectively. Our analysis prescribes\nactionable insights for preference fine-tuning of LLMs and informs how data\nshould be collected for maximal improvement.",

We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by\nfine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales.\nOur experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and\nTic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making\nabilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing\ngap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as\n$\\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and\nself-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for\ndecision-making.",

However, fine-tuning reinforcement learning (RL) models\nremains a challenge. This work conceptualizes one specific cause of poor\ntransfer, accentuated in the RL setting by the interplay between actions and\nobservations: forgetting of pre-trained capabilities. Namely, a model\ndeteriorates on the state subspace of the downstream task not visited in the\ninitial phase of fine-tuning, on which the model behaved well due to\npre-training. This way, we lose the anticipated transfer benefits. We identify\nconditions when this problem occurs, showing that it is common and, in many\ncases, catastrophic. Through a detailed empirical analysis of the challenging\nNetHack and Montezuma's Revenge environments, we show that standard knowledge\nretention techniques mitigate the problem and thus allow us to take full\nadvantage of the pre-trained capabilities. In particular, in NetHack, we\nachieve a new state-of-the-art for neural models, improving the previous best\nscore from $5$K to over $10$K points in the Human Monk scenario.",

In this study, we revisit this\ndefinition of Event Extraction (EE) by introducing two key argument types that\ncannot be modeled by existing EE frameworks. First, implicit arguments are\nevent arguments which are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but can be\ninferred through context. Second, scattered arguments are event arguments that\nare composed of information scattered throughout the text. These two argument\ntypes are crucial to elicit the full breadth of information required for proper\nevent modeling.\n  To support the extraction of explicit, implicit, and scattered arguments, we\ndevelop a novel dataset, DiscourseEE, which includes 7,464 argument annotations\nfrom online health discourse. Notably, 51.2% of the arguments are implicit, and\n17.4% are scattered, making DiscourseEE a unique corpus for complex event\nextraction. Additionally, we formulate argument extraction as a text generation\nproblem to facilitate the extraction of complex argument types.

Our research shows\nthat trigger effectiveness varies based on the extraction task's\ncharacteristics and data quality, with basic, automatically-generated triggers\nserving as a viable alternative to human-annotated ones. Furthermore, providing\ndetailed event descriptions to the extraction model helps maintain robust\nperformance even when trigger quality degrades.

For DECI, we highlight approaches focused on event graph reasoning and\nprompt-based techniques to address the complexity of cross-sentence causal\ninference. Additionally, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and open\nchallenges of each approach. We further conduct an extensive quantitative\nevaluation of various ECI methods on two benchmark datasets.

Previously,\ntheir context window size imposed a limit on the number of examples that can be\nshown, making example selection techniques crucial for identifying the\nmaximally effective set of examples. However, the recent advent of Long Context\nLanguage Models (LCLMs) has significantly increased the number of examples that\ncan be included in context, raising an important question of whether ICL\nperformance in a many-shot regime is still sensitive to the method of sample\nselection. To answer this, we revisit these approaches in the context of LCLMs\nthrough extensive experiments on 18 datasets spanning 4 tasks. Surprisingly, we\nobserve that sophisticated example selection techniques do not yield\nsignificant improvements over a simple random sample selection method. Instead,\nwe find that the advent of LCLMs has fundamentally shifted the challenge of ICL\nfrom that of selecting the most effective examples to that of collecting\nsufficient examples to fill the context window. Specifically, in certain\ndatasets, including all available examples does not fully utilize the context\nwindow; however, by augmenting the examples in context with a simple data\naugmentation approach, we substantially improve ICL performance by 5%.",

However, this knowledge is\ninherently limited, relying heavily on the characteristics of the training\ndata. Consequently, using external datasets to incorporate new information or\nrefine the capabilities of LLMs on previously seen information poses a\nsignificant challenge. In this study, we compare two common approaches:\nunsupervised fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate\nboth approaches on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks across different\ntopics. Our findings reveal that while unsupervised fine-tuning offers some\nimprovement, RAG consistently outperforms it, both for existing knowledge\nencountered during training and entirely new knowledge. Moreover, we find that\nLLMs struggle to learn new factual information through unsupervised\nfine-tuning, and that exposing them to numerous variations of the same fact\nduring training could alleviate this problem.",

In this paper, we find that ICL\nfalls short of handling specification-heavy tasks, which are tasks with\ncomplicated and extensive task specifications, requiring several hours for\nordinary humans to master, such as traditional information extraction tasks.\nThe performance of ICL on these tasks mostly cannot reach half of the\nstate-of-the-art results. To explore the reasons behind this failure, we\nconduct comprehensive experiments on 18 specification-heavy tasks with various\nLLMs and identify three primary reasons: inability to specifically understand\ncontext, misalignment in task schema comprehension with humans, and inadequate\nlong-text understanding ability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that through\nfine-tuning, LLMs can achieve decent performance on these tasks, indicating\nthat the failure of ICL is not an inherent flaw of LLMs, but rather a drawback\nof existing alignment methods that renders LLMs incapable of handling\ncomplicated specification-heavy tasks via ICL. To substantiate this, we perform\ndedicated instruction tuning on LLMs for these tasks and observe a notable\nimprovement. We hope the analyses in this paper could facilitate advancements\nin alignment methods enabling LLMs to meet more sophisticated human demands.",

However, they struggle with more challenging task like\nDiscovery with 174 labels, suggesting a gap in their ability to process long,\ncontext-rich sequences. Further analysis reveals a bias towards labels\npresented later in the sequence and a need for improved reasoning over multiple\npieces of information.

To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and\nexploration of LLM efforts for IE tasks, in this study, we survey the most\nrecent advancements in this field. We first present an extensive overview by\ncategorizing these works in terms of various IE subtasks and techniques, and\nthen we empirically analyze the most advanced methods and discover the emerging\ntrend of IE tasks with LLMs. Based on a thorough review conducted, we identify\nseveral insights in technique and promising research directions that deserve\nfurther exploration in future studies. We maintain a public repository and\nconsistently update related works and resources on GitHub\n(\\href{https://github.com/quqxui/Awesome-LLM4IE-Papers}{LLM4IE repository})",

            "abstract": "Relation extraction (RE) is an important task that aims to identify the\nrelationships between entities in texts. While large language models (LLMs)\nhave revealed remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capability for general zero\nand few-shot learning, recent studies indicate that current LLMs still struggle\nwith zero and few-shot RE. Previous studies are mainly dedicated to design\nprompt formats and select good examples for improving ICL-based RE. Although\nboth factors are vital for ICL, if one can fundamentally boost the ICL\ncapability of LLMs in RE, the zero and few-shot RE performance via ICL would be\nsignificantly improved. To this end, we introduce \\textsc{Micre} (\\textbf{M}eta\n\\textbf{I}n-\\textbf{C}ontext learning of LLMs for \\textbf{R}elation\n\\textbf{E}xtraction), a new meta-training framework for zero and few-shot RE\nwhere an LLM is tuned to do ICL on a diverse collection of RE datasets (i.e.,\nlearning to learn in context for RE). Through meta-training, the model becomes\nmore effectively to learn a new RE task in context by conditioning on a few\ntraining examples with no parameter updates or task-specific templates at\ninference time, enabling better zero and few-shot task generalization. We\nexperiment \\textsc{Micre} on various LLMs with different model scales and 12\npublic RE datasets, and then evaluate it on unseen RE benchmarks under zero and\nfew-shot settings. \\textsc{Micre} delivers comparable or superior performance\ncompared to a range of baselines including supervised fine-tuning and typical\nin-context learning methods. We find that the gains are particular significant\nfor larger model scales, and using a diverse set of the meta-training RE\ndatasets is key to improvements. Empirically, we show that \\textsc{Micre} can\ntransfer the relation semantic knowledge via relation label name during\ninference on target RE datasets.",

The main goal of LLM-generated text\ndetection is to determine whether text is generated by an LLM, which is a basic\nbinary classification task. In our work, we mainly use three different\nclassification methods based on open source datasets: traditional machine\nlearning techniques such as logistic regression, k-means clustering, Gaussian\nNaive Bayes, support vector machines, and methods based on converters such as\nBERT, and finally algorithms that use LLMs to detect LLM-generated text.

In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs\nand want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content\nwithin the institution. We answer the following question: Given a piece of\ntext, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can\nbe a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process\nwith complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to\ndistinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$\n(in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and\nhuman-generated texts. We prove that our tests' type I and type II errors\ndecrease exponentially as text length increases. For designing our tests for a\ngiven string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by the evaluator\nmodel $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average\nentropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability\nin the string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with\nan exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the\nstring under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. For our\nexperiments: First, we present experiments using open-source LLMs to support\nour theoretical results, and then we provide experiments in a black-box setting\nwith adversarial attacks. Practically, our work enables guaranteed finding of\nthe origin of harmful or false LLM-generated text, which can be useful for\ncombating misinformation and compliance with emerging AI regulations.",

While their practical applications are now\nwidespread, their potential for misuse, such as generating fake news and\ncommitting plagiarism, has posed significant concerns. To address this issue,\ndetectors have been developed to evaluate whether a given text is\nhuman-generated or AI-generated. Among others, zero-shot detectors stand out as\neffective approaches that do not require additional training data and are often\nlikelihood-based. In chat-based applications, users commonly input prompts and\nutilize the AI-generated texts. However, zero-shot detectors typically analyze\nthese texts in isolation, neglecting the impact of the original prompts. It is\nconceivable that this approach may lead to a discrepancy in likelihood\nassessments between the text generation phase and the detection phase. So far,\nthere remains an unverified gap concerning how the presence or absence of\nprompts impacts detection accuracy for zero-shot detectors. In this paper, we\nintroduce an evaluative framework to empirically analyze the impact of prompts\non the detection accuracy of AI-generated text. We assess various zero-shot\ndetectors using both white-box detection, which leverages the prompt, and\nblack-box detection, which operates without prompt information.

The travel dataset was sourced from the the\nReddit API by requesting posts from travel-related subreddits to get\ntravel-related conversation prompts and personalized travel experiences, and\naugmented for each fine-tuning method. We used two pretrained LLMs utilized for\nfine-tuning research: LLaMa 2 7B, and Mistral 7B. QLoRA and RAFT are applied to\nthe two pretrained models. The inferences from these models are extensively\nevaluated against the aforementioned metrics. The best model according to human\nevaluation and some GPT-4 metrics was Mistral RAFT, so this underwent a\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training pipeline, and\nultimately was evaluated as the best model. Our main findings are that: 1)\nquantitative and Ragas metrics do not align with human evaluation, 2) Open AI\nGPT-4 evaluation most aligns with human evaluation, 3) it is essential to keep\nhumans in the loop for evaluation because, 4) traditional NLP metrics\ninsufficient, 5) Mistral generally outperformed LLaMa, 6) RAFT outperforms\nQLoRA, but still needs postprocessing, 7) RLHF improves model performance\nsignificantly. Next steps include improving data quality, increasing data\nquantity, exploring RAG methods, and focusing data collection on a specific\ncity, which would improve data quality by narrowing the focus, while creating a\nuseful product.",

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated their effectiveness in diverse domains, showcasing remarkable\ncapabilities even in zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning for various\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Nevertheless, their potential and\napplicability in the context of financial sentiment analysis have not been\nthoroughly explored yet. To bridge this gap, we employ two approaches:\nin-context learning (with a focus on gpt-3.5-turbo model) and fine-tuning LLMs\non a finance-domain dataset. Given the computational costs associated with\nfine-tuning LLMs with large parameter sizes, our focus lies on smaller LLMs,\nspanning from 250M to 3B parameters for fine-tuning. We then compare the\nperformances with state-of-the-art results to evaluate their effectiveness in\nthe finance-domain. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned smaller LLMs can\nachieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art fine-tuned LLMs, even with\nmodels having fewer parameters and a smaller training dataset. Additionally,\nthe zero-shot and one-shot performance of LLMs produces comparable results with\nfine-tuned smaller LLMs and state-of-the-art outcomes. Furthermore, our\nanalysis demonstrates that there is no observed enhancement in performance for\nfinance-domain sentiment analysis when the number of shots for in-context\nlearning is increased.",

While their practical applications are now\nwidespread, their potential for misuse, such as generating fake news and\ncommitting plagiarism, has posed significant concerns. To address this issue,\ndetectors have been developed to evaluate whether a given text is\nhuman-generated or AI-generated. Among others, zero-shot detectors stand out as\neffective approaches that do not require additional training data and are often\nlikelihood-based. In chat-based applications, users commonly input prompts and\nutilize the AI-generated texts. However, zero-shot detectors typically analyze\nthese texts in isolation, neglecting the impact of the original prompts. It is\nconceivable that this approach may lead to a discrepancy in likelihood\nassessments between the text generation phase and the detection phase. So far,\nthere remains an unverified gap concerning how the presence or absence of\nprompts impacts detection accuracy for zero-shot detectors. In this paper, we\nintroduce an evaluative framework to empirically analyze the impact of prompts\non the detection accuracy of AI-generated text. We assess various zero-shot\ndetectors using both white-box detection, which leverages the prompt, and\nblack-box detection, which operates without prompt information. Our experiments\nreveal the significant influence of prompts on detection accuracy. Remarkably,\ncompared with black-box detection without prompts, the white-box methods using\nprompts demonstrate an increase in AUC of at least $0.1$ across all zero-shot\ndetectors tested.

In this survey, we collate recent\nresearch breakthroughs in this area and underscore the pressing need to bolster\ndetector research. We also delve into prevalent datasets, elucidating their\nlimitations and developmental requirements. Furthermore, we analyze various\nLLM-generated text detection paradigms, shedding light on challenges like\nout-of-distribution problems, potential attacks, real-world data issues and the\nlack of effective evaluation framework. Conclusively, we highlight interesting\ndirections for future research in LLM-generated text detection to advance the\nimplementation of responsible artificial intelligence (AI). Our aim with this\nsurvey is to provide a clear and comprehensive introduction for newcomers while\nalso offering seasoned researchers a valuable update in the field of\nLLM-generated text detection.

The study comprehensively explores various LLM sizes and families,\nand assesses the impact of conversational fine-tuning techniques, quantization,\nand watermarking on classifier generalization. The research also explores Model\nAttribution, encompassing source model identification, model family, and model\nsize classification, in addition to quantization and watermarking detection.\nOur results reveal several key findings: a clear inverse relationship between\nclassifier effectiveness and model size, with larger LLMs being more\nchallenging to detect, especially when the classifier is trained on data from\nsmaller models. Training on data from similarly sized LLMs can improve\ndetection performance from larger models but may lead to decreased performance\nwhen dealing with smaller models. Additionally, model attribution experiments\nshow promising results in identifying source models and model families,\nhighlighting detectable signatures in LLM-generated text, with particularly\nremarkable outcomes in watermarking detection, while no detectable signatures\nof quantization were observed.

To fill this\ngap, we systematize existing LLM watermarkers and watermark removal attacks,\nmapping out their design spaces. We then develop WaterPark, a unified platform\nthat integrates 10 state-of-the-art watermarkers and 12 representative attacks.\nMore importantly, by leveraging WaterPark, we conduct a comprehensive\nassessment of existing watermarkers, unveiling the impact of various design\nchoices on their attack robustness. We further explore the best practices to\noperate watermarkers in adversarial environments.

            "abstract": "Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for detecting texts\ngenerated by LLMs. Current research has primarily focused on three design\ncriteria: high quality of the watermarked text, high detectability, and\nrobustness against removal attack. However, the security against spoofing\nattacks remains relatively understudied. For example, a piggyback attack can\nmaliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate\nspeech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation\nof the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending\nagainst spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to\nsemantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and\n(2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the\nlocal, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that post-hoc\nembeds watermarks into a given target text while preserving its original\nmeaning. Our method introduces a semantic mapping model, which guides the\ngeneration of a green-red token list, contrastively trained to be sensitive to\nsemantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving changes.\nExperiments on two standard benchmarks demonstrate strong robustness against\nremoval attacks and security against spoofing attacks, including sentiment\nreversal and toxic content insertion, while maintaining high watermark\ndetectability. Our approach offers a significant step toward more secure and\nsemantically aware watermarking for LLMs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/contrastive-watermark.",

Prior work suggests that language models (LMs)\noften fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive success\non research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the\ninductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through iterative hypothesis\nrefinement, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process\nthan standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a\nthree-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form\nof textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs are\nphenomenal hypothesis proposers (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when\ncoupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to\nsystematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves\nstrong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing\ncausal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However,\nthey also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance\ngaps between rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule\napplication (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs\nare proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules.\nThrough empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies\nbetween the inductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on\nboth the potentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks.",

Recent work evaluates large language models (LLMs) on inductive\nreasoning tasks by directly prompting them yielding \"in context learning.\" This\nworks well for straightforward inductive tasks but performs poorly on complex\ntasks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we\npropose to improve the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs by generating\nexplicit hypotheses at multiple levels of abstraction: we prompt the LLM to\npropose multiple abstract hypotheses about the problem, in natural language,\nthen implement the natural language hypotheses as concrete Python programs.\nThese programs can be verified by running on observed examples and generalized\nto novel inputs. To reduce the hypothesis search space, we explore steps to\nfilter the set of hypotheses to implement: we either ask the LLM to summarize\nthem into a smaller set of hypotheses or ask human annotators to select a\nsubset. We verify our pipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive\nreasoning benchmark, its variant 1D-ARC, string transformation dataset SyGuS,\nand list transformation dataset List Functions. On a random 100-problem subset\nof ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves 30% accuracy,\noutperforming the direct prompting baseline (accuracy of 17%). With the minimal\nhuman input of selecting from LLM-generated candidates, performance is boosted\nto 33%.

One of the most promising\napplications is their role as evaluators based on natural language responses,\nreferred to as ''LLMs-as-judges''. This framework has attracted growing\nattention from both academia and industry due to their excellent effectiveness,\nability to generalize across tasks, and interpretability in the form of natural\nlanguage. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the LLMs-as-judges\nparadigm from five key perspectives: Functionality, Methodology, Applications,\nMeta-evaluation, and Limitations. We begin by providing a systematic definition\nof LLMs-as-Judges and introduce their functionality (Why use LLM judges?). Then\nwe address methodology to construct an evaluation system with LLMs (How to use\nLLM judges?). Additionally, we investigate the potential domains for their\napplication (Where to use LLM judges?) and discuss methods for evaluating them\nin various contexts (How to evaluate LLM judges?). Finally, we provide a\ndetailed analysis of the limitations of LLM judges and discuss potential future\ndirections. Through a structured and comprehensive analysis, we aim aims to\nprovide insights on the development and application of LLMs-as-judges in both\nresearch and practice.

Building upon pre-trained LLMs, this family of models\nfurther develops multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities that are\nimpressive, such as writing code given a flow chart or creating stories based\non an image. In the development process, evaluation is critical since it\nprovides intuitive feedback and guidance on improving models. Distinct from the\ntraditional train-eval-test paradigm that only favors a single task like image\nclassification, the versatility of MLLMs has spurred the rise of various new\nbenchmarks and evaluation methods. In this paper, we aim to present a\ncomprehensive survey of MLLM evaluation, discussing four key aspects: 1) the\nsummarised benchmarks types divided by the evaluation capabilities, including\nfoundation capabilities, model self-analysis, and extented applications; 2) the\ntypical process of benchmark counstruction, consisting of data collection,\nannotation, and precautions; 3) the systematic evaluation manner composed of\njudge, metric, and toolkit; 4) the outlook for the next benchmark.

AI models, such as state-of-the-art neural networks and\ndeep learning models, are often seen as \"black boxes\" due to a lack of\ntransparency. As users cannot fully understand how the models reach\nconclusions, users have difficulty trusting decisions from AI models, which\nleads to less effective decision-making processes, reduced accountabilities,\nand unclear potential biases. A challenge arises in developing explainable AI\n(XAI) models to gain users' trust and provide insights into how models generate\ntheir outputs. With the development of Large Language Models, we want to\nexplore the possibilities of using human language-based models, LLMs, for model\nexplainabilities.

            "abstract": "Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions\ngoverned by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop\ncapable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major\napproach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding\nand generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language\nmodels to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)\nhave been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora,\nshowing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers\nhave found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further\nstudy the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size.\nInterestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged\nlanguage models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also\nshow some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language\nmodels. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research\ncommunity has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of\nsignificant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by\nboth academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT,\nwhich has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution\nof LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which\nwould revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this\nsurvey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background,\nkey findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major\naspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and\ncapacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for\ndeveloping LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.",

Meta-analysis is a robust\nstatistical method that synthesizes the findings of multiple studies support\narticles to provide a comprehensive understanding. We know that a meta-article\nprovides a structured analysis of several articles. However, conducting\nmeta-analysis by hand is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and susceptible to\nhuman error, highlighting the need for automated pipelines to streamline the\nprocess. Our research introduces a novel approach that fine-tunes the LLM on\nextensive scientific datasets to address challenges in big data handling and\nstructured data extraction. We automate and optimize the meta-analysis process\nby integrating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Tailored through prompt\nengineering and a new loss metric, Inverse Cosine Distance (ICD), designed for\nfine-tuning on large contextual datasets, LLMs efficiently generate structured\nmeta-analysis content. Human evaluation then assesses relevance and provides\ninformation on model performance in key metrics. This research demonstrates\nthat fine-tuned models outperform non-fine-tuned models, with fine-tuned LLMs\ngenerating 87.6% relevant meta-analysis abstracts. The relevance of the\ncontext, based on human evaluation, shows a reduction in irrelevancy from 4.56%\nto 1.9%. These experiments were conducted in a low-resource environment,\nhighlighting the study's contribution to enhancing the efficiency and\nreliability of meta-analysis automation.",

Key insights from our work include: (i) larger batch sizes paired with\nlower learning rates lead to improved model performance on benchmarks such as\nMMLU, MTBench, and Open LLM Leaderboard; (ii) early-stage training dynamics,\nsuch as lower gradient norms and higher loss values, are strong indicators of\nbetter final model performance, enabling early termination of sub-optimal runs\nand significant computational savings; (iii) through a thorough exploration of\nhyperparameters like warmup steps and learning rate schedules, we provide\nguidance for practitioners and find that certain simplifications do not\ncompromise performance; and (iv) we observed no significant difference in\nperformance between phased and stacked training strategies, but stacked\ntraining is simpler and more sample efficient.

However, CE maximizes the likelihood of observed data without\naccounting for alternative possibilities. As such, CE usually leads to reduced\ndiversity in the model's outputs, which hinders further development that\nrequires sampling to explore better responses. To address this limitation, this\npaper introduces a new game-theoretic formulation for SFT. In this framework,\nan auxiliary variable is introduced to regulate the learning process. We prove\nthat the proposed game-theoretic approach connects to the problem of reverse KL\nminimization with entropy regularization. This regularization prevents\nover-memorization of training data and promotes output diversity. To implement\nthis framework, we develop GEM, a new training algorithm that is\ncomputationally efficient as CE by leveraging some unique properties of LLMs.\nEmpirical studies of pre-trained models from 3B to 70B parameters show that GEM\nachieves comparable downstream performance to CE while significantly enhancing\noutput diversity. This increased diversity translates to performance gains in\ntest-time compute scaling for chat and code generation tasks. Moreover, we\nobserve that preserving output diversity has the added benefit of mitigating\nforgetting, as maintaining diverse outputs encourages models to retain\npre-trained knowledge throughout the training process.",

For humans to be able to trust LLM-based applications, their\noutputs should be consistent when prompted with inputs that carry the same\nmeaning or intent. Despite this need, there is no known mechanism to control\nand guide LLMs to be more consistent at inference time. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel alignment strategy to maximize semantic consistency in LLM\noutputs. Our proposal is based on Chain of Guidance (CoG), a multistep\nprompting technique that generates highly consistent outputs from LLMs. For\nclosed-book question-answering (Q&A) tasks, when compared to direct prompting,\nthe outputs generated using CoG show improved consistency. While other\napproaches like template-based responses and majority voting may offer\nalternative paths to consistency, our work focuses on exploring the potential\nof guided prompting. We use synthetic data sets comprised of consistent\ninput-output pairs to fine-tune LLMs to produce consistent and correct outputs.\nOur fine-tuned models are more than twice as consistent compared to base models\nand show strong generalization capabilities by producing consistent outputs\nover datasets not used in the fine-tuning process.",

Given this\nvariety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are\nscarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what\nbottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of\nsynthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity,\nand complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in\nopen-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream\nmodels. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model\ngeneralization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize\nthe existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the\ndownstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various\ncomponents in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This\nexamination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation\nalgorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on\ndata QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance\nof balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and\nself-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data,\noften there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity\nwhich impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are\ncurrently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting\noutput diversity and the potential for self-improvement.

Typically,\ninstructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which\nare often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This,\nat scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance\nand robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for\nthe unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it\ngathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest\nprobability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most\nclosely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with\nstandard SFT training.\n  We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various\nsolutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune\ncommonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on\nGRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines,\nincluding distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to\n13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum\nperformance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to\nrealistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3\nand Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data\nby 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average\nperformance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs,\nGRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.",

While\nthese paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often\ninvolve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning.\nTo systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new\nmultimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a\nsix-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite\nand verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual\nreasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same\ndata source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing\nSFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn\nreasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid\nreasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module\nintegrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more\ngenuine, adaptive reasoning behavior.

It poses a significant challenge to develop\ncapable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major\napproach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding\nand generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language\nmodels to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)\nhave been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora,\nshowing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers\nhave found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further\nstudy the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size.\nInterestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged\nlanguage models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also\nshow some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language\nmodels. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research\ncommunity has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of\nsignificant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by\nboth academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT,\nwhich has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution\nof LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which\nwould revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this\nsurvey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background,\nkey findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major\naspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and\ncapacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for\ndeveloping LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.",

This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of PoLMs,\nsystematically tracing their evolution across five core paradigms: Fine-tuning,\nwhich enhances task-specific accuracy; Alignment, which ensures alignment with\nhuman preferences; Reasoning, which advances multi-step inference despite\nchallenges in reward design; Efficiency, which optimizes resource utilization\namidst increasing complexity; and Integration and Adaptation, which extend\ncapabilities across diverse modalities while addressing coherence issues.\nCharting progress from ChatGPT's foundational alignment strategies to\nDeepSeek-R1's innovative reasoning advancements, we illustrate how PoLMs\nleverage datasets to mitigate biases, deepen reasoning capabilities, and\nenhance domain adaptability. Our contributions include a pioneering synthesis\nof PoLM evolution, a structured taxonomy categorizing techniques and datasets,\nand a strategic agenda emphasizing the role of LRMs in improving reasoning\nproficiency and domain flexibility.

The latter is typically evaluated\nthrough multiple benchmarks framed as multiple-choice instances of the former.\nAccording to influential leaderboards hosted by the Allen Institute (evaluating\nstate-of-the-art performance on commonsense reasoning benchmarks), models based\non such transformer methods are approaching human-like performance and have\naverage accuracy well over 80% on many benchmarks. Since these are commonsense\nbenchmarks, a model that generalizes on commonsense reasoning should not\nexperience much performance loss across multiple commonsense benchmarks. In\nthis paper, we study the generalization issue in detail by designing and\nconducting a rigorous scientific study. Using five common benchmarks, multiple\ncontrols and statistical analysis, we find clear evidence that fine-tuned\ncommonsense language models still do not generalize well, even with moderate\nchanges to the experimental setup, and may, in fact, be susceptible to dataset\nbias.

However, under-translation and over-translation remain two challenging\nproblems in state-of-the-art NMT systems. In this work, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis on the underlying cause of under-translation in NMT, providing an\nexplanation from the perspective of decoding objective. To optimize the beam\nsearch objective, the model tends to overlook words it is less confident about,\nleading to the under-translation phenomenon. Correspondingly, the model's\nconfidence in predicting the End Of Sentence (EOS) diminishes when\nunder-translation occurs, serving as a mild penalty for under-translated\ncandidates. Building upon this analysis, we propose employing the confidence of\npredicting EOS as a detector for under-translation, and strengthening the\nconfidence-based penalty to penalize candidates with a high risk of\nunder-translation. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that\nour method can accurately detect and rectify under-translated outputs, with\nminor impact on other correct translations.",

While the variance of\nthe REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and\nusing a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To\naddress these challenges, we systematically analyze the\nefficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose\nleave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP\ncombines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling\nmultiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the\nrobustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling.\nOur results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on\nvarious black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between\ncomputational efficiency and performance.",

Traditional diffusion-based\nmethods struggle to extrapolate to unseen physical conditions (eg, velocity)\ndue to their reliance on data-driven approximations. To address this, we\npropose to integrate symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning to enforce\nphysical consistency in video generation. We first introduce the Diffusion\nTimestep Tokenizer (DDT), which learns discrete, recursive visual tokens by\nrecovering visual attributes lost during the diffusion process. The recursive\nvisual tokens enable symbolic reasoning by a large language model. Based on it,\nwe propose the Phys-AR framework, which consists of two stages: The first stage\nuses supervised fine-tuning to transfer symbolic knowledge, while the second\nstage applies reinforcement learning to optimize the model's reasoning\nabilities through reward functions based on physical conditions. Our approach\nallows the model to dynamically adjust and improve the physical properties of\ngenerated videos, ensuring adherence to physical laws.

Consequently,\nwe introduce an Iterative Preference Optimization strategy to enhance generated\nvideo quality by incorporating human feedback. Specifically, IPO exploits a\ncritic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct\nPreference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky\nOptimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance\nof signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video\nquality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc.\nIn addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large\nlanguage model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels\nwithout need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently\nperform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the\nneed of tediously manual labeling.

Proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy\noptimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive\nto hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE,\non the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high\nmemory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal\nperformance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of\nthe REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and\nusing a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To\naddress these challenges, we systematically analyze the\nefficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose\nleave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP\ncombines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling\nmultiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the\nrobustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling.\nOur results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on\nvarious black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between\ncomputational efficiency and performance.",

Empirically, DDPO is able to adapt text-to-image\ndiffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting,\nsuch as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as\naesthetic quality. Finally, we show that DDPO can improve prompt-image\nalignment using feedback from a vision-language model without the need for\nadditional data collection or human annotation.

Traditional diffusion-based\nmethods struggle to extrapolate to unseen physical conditions (eg, velocity)\ndue to their reliance on data-driven approximations. To address this, we\npropose to integrate symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning to enforce\nphysical consistency in video generation. We first introduce the Diffusion\nTimestep Tokenizer (DDT), which learns discrete, recursive visual tokens by\nrecovering visual attributes lost during the diffusion process. The recursive\nvisual tokens enable symbolic reasoning by a large language model. Based on it,\nwe propose the Phys-AR framework, which consists of two stages: The first stage\nuses supervised fine-tuning to transfer symbolic knowledge, while the second\nstage applies reinforcement learning to optimize the model's reasoning\nabilities through reward functions based on physical conditions. Our approach\nallows the model to dynamically adjust and improve the physical properties of\ngenerated videos, ensuring adherence to physical laws. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that PhysAR can generate videos that are physically consistent.",

The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized\nAI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and\n(iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the\npotential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual\nawareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent\nsystems.

Our findings demonstrate UNMT's potential to\ntranslate EC, illustrating that task complexity characterized by semantic\ndiversity enhances EC translatability, while higher task complexity with\nconstrained semantic variability exhibits pragmatic EC, which, although\nchallenging to interpret, remains suitable for translation. This research marks\nthe first attempt, to our knowledge, to translate EC without the aid of\nparallel data.",

Our model builds upon the recent work on unsupervised\nembedding mappings, and consists of a slightly modified attentional\nencoder-decoder model that can be trained on monolingual corpora alone using a\ncombination of denoising and backtranslation. Despite the simplicity of the\napproach, our system obtains 15.56 and 10.21 BLEU points in WMT 2014\nFrench-to-English and German-to-English translation.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\ndataset, named Realistic image Quality and Aesthetic (RealQA), including 14,715\nUGC images, each of which is annoted with 10 fine-grained attributes. These\nattributes span three levels: low level (e.g., image clarity), middle level\n(e.g., subject integrity) and high level (e.g., composition). Besides, we\nconduct a series of in-depth and comprehensive investigations into how to\neffectively predict numerical scores using MLLMs. Surprisingly, by predicting\njust two extra significant digits, the next token paradigm can achieve SOTA\nperformance. Furthermore, with the help of chain of thought (CoT) combined with\nthe learnt fine-grained attributes, the proposed method can outperform SOTA\nmethods on five public datasets for IQA and IAA with superior interpretability\nand show strong zero-shot generalization for video quality assessment (VQA).\nThe code and dataset will be released.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation\nmodel for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from\nvision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both\nimage and video understanding benchmarks.",

To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of\nusing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for\nAIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding\ncapabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV\nevaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench.

Recently, multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) have shown great potential in image quality assessment (IQA) and\nimage aesthetic assessment (IAA). Despite this progress, effectively scoring\nthe quality and aesthetics of UGC images still faces two main challenges: 1) A\nsingle score is inadequate to capture the hierarchical human perception. 2) How\nto use MLLMs to output numerical scores, such as mean opinion scores (MOS),\nremains an open question. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\ndataset, named Realistic image Quality and Aesthetic (RealQA), including 14,715\nUGC images, each of which is annoted with 10 fine-grained attributes. These\nattributes span three levels: low level (e.g., image clarity), middle level\n(e.g., subject integrity) and high level (e.g., composition). Besides, we\nconduct a series of in-depth and comprehensive investigations into how to\neffectively predict numerical scores using MLLMs. Surprisingly, by predicting\njust two extra significant digits, the next token paradigm can achieve SOTA\nperformance. Furthermore, with the help of chain of thought (CoT) combined with\nthe learnt fine-grained attributes, the proposed method can outperform SOTA\nmethods on five public datasets for IQA and IAA with superior interpretability\nand show strong zero-shot generalization for video quality assessment (VQA).\nThe code and dataset will be released.",

            "abstract": "Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models\nproduce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human\nexpectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main\ncategories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to\nevaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack\nalignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based\nbenchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a\nlimited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To\naddress these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with\nhuman preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfeaturing a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This\nbenchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across\nall dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By\nincorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench\nprovides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation.\nExperiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench\nachieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions.\nMoreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human\nevaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights,\nsuggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation\nmodel for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from\nvision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both\nimage and video understanding benchmarks.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce MLLM-CompBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the comparative\nreasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).\nMLLM-CompBench mines and pairs images through visually oriented questions\ncovering eight dimensions of relative comparison: visual attribute, existence,\nstate, emotion, temporality, spatiality, quantity, and quality. We curate a\ncollection of around 40K image pairs using metadata from diverse vision\ndatasets and CLIP similarity scores. These image pairs span a broad array of\nvisual domains, including animals, fashion, sports, and both outdoor and indoor\nscenes. The questions are carefully crafted to discern relative characteristics\nbetween two images and are labeled by human annotators for accuracy and\nrelevance.

In\nsmall PLMs, there are usually noticeable performance differences among PET\nmethods. Nevertheless, as the model scale increases, the performance\ndifferences become marginal. Hence, we hypothesize that model scaling mitigates\nthe impact of design differences on PET methods. To investigate this\nhypothesis, we introduce a more flexible PET method called Arbitrary PET (APET)\nmethod. The APET method is compatible with a tunable module, which consists of\nany number of parameters distributed in arbitrary positions. Then, we utilize\nit and conduct experiments on 11 NLP tasks across 3 representative PLMs. Our\ninvestigations reveal that model scaling (1) mitigates the effects of the\npositions of tunable parameters on performance, and (2) enables tuning methods\nto achieve performance comparable to full-parameter fine-tuning by optimizing\nfewer tunable parameters. Intriguingly, we also observe that tuning methods\noptimize the similar number of tunable parameters to exceed random guess\nperformance on different tasks. We collectively discuss this phenomenon and the\ntwo aforementioned findings from an optimization perspective to understand the\nunderlying mechanisms. These conclusions enhance our understanding of the\nimpact of model scaling on PET and assist in designing more effective and\nefficient PET methods for PLMs of different scales.

However, existing\nMoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and\noptimization challenges.

Experiments\non language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs\nand coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off.

Based on only a few key hyperparameters of the\nLLM architecture and the size of training data, we obtain a quite accurate MMLU\nprediction of various LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures developed by\ndifferent organizations in different years.

Previous approaches have primarily utilized\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) via online RL methods such as\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Recently, offline methods such as Sequence\nLikelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nemerged as attractive alternatives, offering improvements in stability and\nscalability while maintaining competitive performance. SLiC refines its loss\nfunction using sequence pairs sampled from a supervised fine-tuned (SFT)\npolicy, while DPO directly optimizes language models based on preference data,\nforegoing the need for a separate reward model. However, the maximum likelihood\nestimator (MLE) of the target optimal policy requires labeled preference pairs\nsampled from that policy. DPO's lack of a reward model constrains its ability\nto sample preference pairs from the optimal policy, and SLiC is restricted to\nsampling preference pairs only from the SFT policy. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel approach called Statistical Rejection\nSampling Optimization (RSO) that aims to source preference data from the target\noptimal policy using rejection sampling, enabling a more accurate estimation of\nthe optimal policy. We also propose a unified framework that enhances the loss\nfunctions used in both SLiC and DPO from a preference modeling standpoint.\nThrough extensive experiments across three diverse tasks, we demonstrate that\nRSO consistently outperforms both SLiC and DPO on evaluations from both Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) and human raters.",

First, generative\nAI generates content without incorporating explicit or implicit feedback about\nuser interactions. Even if the generated content seems to be more informative\nor well-written, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in user\nactivities, such as clicks. Second, there is a concern with the quality of the\ncontent generative AI produces, which often lacks the distinctiveness and\nauthenticity that human-created content possesses. These two factors can lead\nto content that fails to meet specific needs and preferences of users,\nultimately reducing its potential to be engaging.\n  This paper presents a generic framework of how to improve user engagement\nwith generative AI by leveraging user feedback. Our solutions employ rejection\nsampling, a technique used in reinforcement learning, to boost engagement\nmetrics. We leveraged the framework in the context of email notification\nsubject lines generation for an online social network, and achieved significant\nengagement metric lift including +1% Session and +0.4% Weekly Active Users.

For settings with high-dimensional covariates\n-- such as text data, genomics, or the behavioral social sciences --\nresearchers have proposed methods to adjust for confounding by adapting machine\nlearning methods to the goal of causal estimation. However, empirical\nevaluation of these adjustment methods has been challenging and limited. In\nthis work, we build on a promising empirical evaluation strategy that\nsimplifies evaluation design and uses real data: subsampling randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) to create confounded observational datasets while\nusing the average causal effects from the RCTs as ground-truth. We contribute a\nnew sampling algorithm, which we call RCT rejection sampling, and provide\ntheoretical guarantees that causal identification holds in the observational\ndata to allow for valid comparisons to the ground-truth RCT. Using synthetic\ndata, we show our algorithm indeed results in low bias when oracle estimators\nare evaluated on the confounded samples, which is not always the case for a\npreviously proposed algorithm. In addition to this identification result, we\nhighlight several finite data considerations for evaluation designers who plan\nto use RCT rejection sampling on their own datasets. As a proof of concept, we\nimplement an example evaluation pipeline and walk through these finite data\nconsiderations with a novel, real-world RCT -- which we release publicly --\nconsisting of approximately 70k observations and text data as high-dimensional\ncovariates. Together, these contributions build towards a broader agenda of\nimproved empirical evaluation for causal estimation.",

            "abstract": "Improving the alignment of language models with human preferences remains an\nactive research challenge. Previous approaches have primarily utilized\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) via online RL methods such as\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Recently, offline methods such as Sequence\nLikelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nemerged as attractive alternatives, offering improvements in stability and\nscalability while maintaining competitive performance. SLiC refines its loss\nfunction using sequence pairs sampled from a supervised fine-tuned (SFT)\npolicy, while DPO directly optimizes language models based on preference data,\nforegoing the need for a separate reward model. However, the maximum likelihood\nestimator (MLE) of the target optimal policy requires labeled preference pairs\nsampled from that policy. DPO's lack of a reward model constrains its ability\nto sample preference pairs from the optimal policy, and SLiC is restricted to\nsampling preference pairs only from the SFT policy. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel approach called Statistical Rejection\nSampling Optimization (RSO) that aims to source preference data from the target\noptimal policy using rejection sampling, enabling a more accurate estimation of\nthe optimal policy. We also propose a unified framework that enhances the loss\nfunctions used in both SLiC and DPO from a preference modeling standpoint.\nThrough extensive experiments across three diverse tasks, we demonstrate that\nRSO consistently outperforms both SLiC and DPO on evaluations from both Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) and human raters.",

We\nevaluate a collection of such models (with between 244M and 137B parameters) on\ntwo new benchmarks, MBPP and MathQA-Python, in both the few-shot and\nfine-tuning regimes. Our benchmarks are designed to measure the ability of\nthese models to synthesize short Python programs from natural language\ndescriptions. The Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) dataset contains 974\nprogramming tasks, designed to be solvable by entry-level programmers. The\nMathQA-Python dataset, a Python version of the MathQA benchmark, contains 23914\nproblems that evaluate the ability of the models to synthesize code from more\ncomplex text. On both datasets, we find that synthesis performance scales\nlog-linearly with model size. Our largest models, even without finetuning on a\ncode dataset, can synthesize solutions to 59.6 percent of the problems from\nMBPP using few-shot learning with a well-designed prompt. Fine-tuning on a\nheld-out portion of the dataset improves performance by about 10 percentage\npoints across most model sizes. On the MathQA-Python dataset, the largest\nfine-tuned model achieves 83.8 percent accuracy. Going further, we study the\nmodel's ability to engage in dialog about code, incorporating human feedback to\nimprove its solutions. We find that natural language feedback from a human\nhalves the error rate compared to the model's initial prediction. Additionally,\nwe conduct an error analysis to shed light on where these models fall short and\nwhat types of programs are most difficult to generate. Finally, we explore the\nsemantic grounding of these models by fine-tuning them to predict the results\nof program execution.

Finally, we conduct a comparison between the difficulty assessment\nof tasks by human-annotators and LLMs. Orthogonal to current benchmarking\nevaluation efforts, TaskEval can assist researchers and practitioners in\nfostering better assessments of LLMs. The tasks' characteristics can be used to\nidentify shortcomings within existing benchmarks.

The data set comprises 55 misconceptions about algebra, common\nerrors, and 220 diagnostic examples identified in previous peer-reviewed\nstudies. We provide an example application using a large language model,\nobserving a range of precision and recall scores depending on the topic and\nexperimental setup that reaches 83.9% when including educator feedback and\nrestricting it by topic. We found that topics such as ratios and proportions\nprove as difficult for LLMs as they are for students. We included a human\nassessment of LLMs results and feedback from five middle school math educators\non the clarity and occurrence of misconceptions in the dataset and the\npotential use of AI in conjunction with the dataset. Most educators (80% or\nmore) indicated that they encounter these misconceptions among their students,\nsuggesting the relevance of the data set to teaching middle school algebra.\nDespite varying familiarity with AI tools, four out of five educators expressed\ninterest in using the data set with AI to diagnose student misconceptions or\ntrain teachers.

In addition, current benchmarks\nare prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper,\nwe present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art\nof Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level\nproblems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a\nmethod to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in\nAoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their\nreasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic\npipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with\ntimestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a\ncontamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance.

For this approach to succeed, the\nretrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input\nlength grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and\nmemory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these\ncomplications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time,\nusing its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index\nbased on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system\nretrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly,\nretrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient\niteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language\nmodeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest\nneighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a\nGPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size,\nhowever, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time\ntraining for language modeling.",

Because only well-resourced\ncorporations can train frontier LLMs, we need robust test-time strategies to\ncontrol such biases. Existing solutions, which instruct the LLM to be fair or\nrobust, rely on the model's implicit understanding of bias. Causality provides\na rich formalism through which we can be explicit about our debiasing\nrequirements. Yet, as we show, a naive application of the standard causal\ndebiasing strategy, counterfactual data augmentation, fails under standard\nassumptions to debias predictions at an individual level at test time. To\naddress this, we develop a stratified notion of debiasing called stratified\ninvariance, which can capture a range of debiasing requirements from population\nlevel to individual level through an additional measurement that stratifies the\npredictions. We present a complete observational test for stratified\ninvariance. Finally, we introduce a data augmentation strategy that guarantees\nstratified invariance at test time under suitable assumptions, together with a\nprompting strategy that encourages stratified invariance in LLMs. We show that\nour prompting strategy, unlike implicit instructions, consistently reduces the\nbias of frontier LLMs across a suite of synthetic and real-world benchmarks\nwithout requiring additional data, finetuning or pre-training.",

In this paper, we study the scaling of\ninference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if\nan LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time\ncompute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?\nAnswering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance\nof LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff\ninference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little\nresearch attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time\ninference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for\na number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms\nto scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based\nverifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a\nresponse adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,\nthe effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute\ncritically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation\nmotivates applying a \"compute-optimal\" scaling strategy, which acts to most\neffectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this\ncompute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute\nscaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a\nFLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model\nattains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to\noutperform a 14x larger model.",

Unlike wrongful practices like training\non the test data, leakage, or data contamination, training on the test task is\nnot a malpractice. Rather, the term describes a growing set of practices that\nutilize knowledge about evaluation tasks at training time. We demonstrate that\ntraining on the test task confounds both relative model evaluations and claims\nabout emergent capabilities. We argue that the seeming superiority of one model\nfamily over another may be explained by a different degree of training on the\ntest task. To this end, we propose an effective method to adjust for the effect\nof training on the test task on benchmark evaluations. Put simply, to fine-tune\neach model under comparison on the same task-relevant data prior to evaluation.\nWe then show that instances of emergent behavior disappear gradually as models\ntrain on the test task. Our work promotes a new perspective on the evaluation\nof large language models, with broad implications for benchmarking and the\nstudy of emergent capabilities.",

The core challenge\nof the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to\nground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that\ncommon practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield\nsurprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work,\nwe introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for\ntraining LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs\nby utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and\nmodels. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by\napproximately 159% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore,\nalthough TTRL is only supervised by the Maj@N metric, TTRL has demonstrated\nperformance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model, and\napproach the performance of models trained directly on test data with\nground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general\neffectiveness of TTRL across various tasks, and highlight TTRL's potential for\nbroader tasks and domains. GitHub: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the field of vision-language model pre-training has\nexperienced rapid advancements, driven primarily by the continuous enhancement\nof textual capabilities in large language models. However, existing training\nparadigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality\nimage-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the\navailability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce\nand saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.\nThis study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for\nvision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale\nlow-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a\nviable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)\nachieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language\nmodels through empirical validation. This paper presents three key\ncontributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,\nlow-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO\nmethodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,\nthe non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%\nto 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals\nthat our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their\ncounterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data\nachieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text\npairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support\nin the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1\non a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation\nbenchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and\nknowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.",

Improving this capability requires high-quality\nvision-language data, which is costly and labor-intensive to acquire.\nSelf-training approaches have been effective in single-modal settings to\nalleviate the need for labeled data by leveraging model's own generation.\nHowever, effective self-training remains a challenge regarding the unique\nvisual perception and reasoning capability of LVLMs. To address this, we\nintroduce Self-Training on Image Comprehension (STIC), which emphasizes a\nself-training approach specifically for image comprehension. First, the model\nself-constructs a preference dataset for image descriptions using unlabeled\nimages. Preferred responses are generated through a step-by-step prompt, while\ndis-preferred responses are generated from either corrupted images or\nmisleading prompts. To further self-improve reasoning on the extracted visual\ninformation, we let the model reuse a small portion of existing\ninstruction-tuning data and append its self-generated image descriptions to the\nprompts. We validate the effectiveness of STIC across seven different\nbenchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains of 4.0% on average\nwhile using 70% less supervised fine-tuning data than the current method.\nFurther studies investigate various components of STIC and highlight its\npotential to leverage vast quantities of unlabeled images for self-training.\nCode and data are made publicly available.",

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention\nas a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from\nconstructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in\nresponses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data\nconstruction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We\nidentify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the\nconstructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by\nthe presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference\npolicy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically\nsummarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address\nhallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment\n(OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct\nhallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised\nresponses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO\nachieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B:\n13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared\nto the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.

Improving this capability requires high-quality\nvision-language data, which is costly and labor-intensive to acquire.\nSelf-training approaches have been effective in single-modal settings to\nalleviate the need for labeled data by leveraging model's own generation.\nHowever, effective self-training remains a challenge regarding the unique\nvisual perception and reasoning capability of LVLMs. To address this, we\nintroduce Self-Training on Image Comprehension (STIC), which emphasizes a\nself-training approach specifically for image comprehension. First, the model\nself-constructs a preference dataset for image descriptions using unlabeled\nimages. Preferred responses are generated through a step-by-step prompt, while\ndis-preferred responses are generated from either corrupted images or\nmisleading prompts. To further self-improve reasoning on the extracted visual\ninformation, we let the model reuse a small portion of existing\ninstruction-tuning data and append its self-generated image descriptions to the\nprompts. We validate the effectiveness of STIC across seven different\nbenchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains of 4.0% on average\nwhile using 70% less supervised fine-tuning data than the current method.\nFurther studies investigate various components of STIC and highlight its\npotential to leverage vast quantities of unlabeled images for self-training.\nCode and data are made publicly available.",

However, existing training\nparadigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality\nimage-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the\navailability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce\nand saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.\nThis study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for\nvision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale\nlow-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a\nviable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)\nachieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language\nmodels through empirical validation. This paper presents three key\ncontributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,\nlow-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO\nmethodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,\nthe non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%\nto 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals\nthat our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their\ncounterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data\nachieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text\npairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support\nin the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1\non a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation\nbenchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and\nknowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.",

            "abstract": "Hallucination remains a major challenge for Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention\nas a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from\nconstructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in\nresponses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data\nconstruction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We\nidentify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the\nconstructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by\nthe presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference\npolicy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically\nsummarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address\nhallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment\n(OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct\nhallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised\nresponses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO\nachieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B:\n13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared\nto the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.

Improving this capability requires high-quality\nvision-language data, which is costly and labor-intensive to acquire.\nSelf-training approaches have been effective in single-modal settings to\nalleviate the need for labeled data by leveraging model's own generation.\nHowever, effective self-training remains a challenge regarding the unique\nvisual perception and reasoning capability of LVLMs. To address this, we\nintroduce Self-Training on Image Comprehension (STIC), which emphasizes a\nself-training approach specifically for image comprehension. First, the model\nself-constructs a preference dataset for image descriptions using unlabeled\nimages. Preferred responses are generated through a step-by-step prompt, while\ndis-preferred responses are generated from either corrupted images or\nmisleading prompts. To further self-improve reasoning on the extracted visual\ninformation, we let the model reuse a small portion of existing\ninstruction-tuning data and append its self-generated image descriptions to the\nprompts. We validate the effectiveness of STIC across seven different\nbenchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains of 4.0% on average\nwhile using 70% less supervised fine-tuning data than the current method.\nFurther studies investigate various components of STIC and highlight its\npotential to leverage vast quantities of unlabeled images for self-training.\nCode and data are made publicly available.",

Using a neural network as the wave function\nallows for a more generalized expression of various types of interactions,\nincluding highly non-local interactions, which are closely related to its\nnon-linear activation functions. Additionally, neural networks can represent\nrelatively complex wave functions with relatively small computational resources\nwhen dealing with higher-dimensional systems, which is undoubtedly a\n\"flattening\" advantage.

However, there are still some difficulties in the\noptimization of NQSs, such as local minima, slow convergence, and sign\nstructure optimization. Here, we split a quantum many-body variational wave\nfunction into a multiplication of a real-valued amplitude neural network and a\nsign structure, and focus on the optimization of the amplitude network while\nkeeping the sign structure fixed. The amplitude network is a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) with residual blocks, namely a ResNet. Our method is\ntested on three typical quantum many-body systems. The obtained ground state\nenergies are lower than or comparable to those from traditional variational\nMonte Carlo (VMC) methods and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG).\nSurprisingly, for the frustrated Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model, our results are\nbetter than those of the complex-valued CNN in the literature, implying that\nthe sign structure of the complex-valued NQS is difficult to be optimized. We\nwill study the optimization of the sign structure of NQSs in the future.",

Despite being harmful,\nthese attacks also offer benefits for interpreting and enhancing NMT models,\nthus drawing increased research attention. However, existing studies on\nadversarial attacks are insufficient in both attacking ability and human\nimperceptibility due to their sole focus on the scope of language. This paper\nproposes a novel vision-fused attack (VFA) framework to acquire powerful\nadversarial text, i.e., more aggressive and stealthy. Regarding the attacking\nability, we design the vision-merged solution space enhancement strategy to\nenlarge the limited semantic solution space, which enables us to search for\nadversarial candidates with higher attacking ability. For human\nimperceptibility, we propose the perception-retained adversarial text selection\nstrategy to align the human text-reading mechanism. Thus, the finally selected\nadversarial text could be more deceptive. Extensive experiments on various\nmodels, including large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and GPT-3.5, strongly\nsupport that VFA outperforms the comparisons by large margins (up to 81%/14%\nimprovements on ASR/SSIM).",

            "abstract": "Adversarial generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs), are widely applied for generating various types of data, i.e., images,\ntext, and audio. Accordingly, its promising performance has led to the\nGAN-based adversarial attack methods in the white-box and black-box attack\nscenarios. The importance of transferable black-box attacks lies in their\nability to be effective across different models and settings, more closely\naligning with real-world applications. However, it remains challenging to\nretain the performance in terms of transferable adversarial examples for such\nmethods. Meanwhile, we observe that some enhanced gradient-based transferable\nadversarial attack algorithms require prolonged time for adversarial sample\ngeneration. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel algorithm named GE-AdvGAN to\nenhance the transferability of adversarial samples whilst improving the\nalgorithm's efficiency. The main approach is via optimising the training\nprocess of the generator parameters. With the functional and characteristic\nsimilarity analysis, we introduce a novel gradient editing (GE) mechanism and\nverify its feasibility in generating transferable samples on various models.\nMoreover, by exploring the frequency domain information to determine the\ngradient editing direction, GE-AdvGAN can generate highly transferable\nadversarial samples while minimizing the execution time in comparison to the\nstate-of-the-art transferable adversarial attack algorithms. The performance of\nGE-AdvGAN is comprehensively evaluated by large-scale experiments on different\ndatasets, which results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a Phrase-level Adversarial Example\nGeneration (PAEG) framework to enhance the robustness of the translation model.\nOur method further improves the gradient-based word-level AEG method by\nadopting a phrase-level substitution strategy.

Existing works attempt to\nsegment all objects and consider their features as scene representations.\nHowever, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information\nand missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we\npropose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies\ntask-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks,\nfollowed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained\ndetails in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the\nattention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input.\nIt then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive\nself-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected\nfine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene\nunderstanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room\nunderstanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene\nunderstanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption.\nExperiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene\nunderstanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks.

This growth encompasses not just the creation of 3D objects, but\nalso the rapid development of 3D character and motion generation. Several key\nfactors contribute to this progress.

Due to the high density\nof visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating\ntask-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to\nsegment all objects and consider their features as scene representations.\nHowever, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information\nand missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we\npropose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies\ntask-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks,\nfollowed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained\ndetails in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the\nattention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input.\nIt then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive\nself-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected\nfine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene\nunderstanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room\nunderstanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene\nunderstanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption.\nExperiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene\nunderstanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene\nmagnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.",

Recently, this success has been extended to 3D AIGC,\nwith state-of-the-art methods generating textured 3D models from single images\nor text. However, we argue that current 3D AIGC methods still do not fully\nunleash human creativity. We often imagine 3D content made from multimodal\ninputs, such as what it would look like if my pet bunny were eating a doughnut\non the table. In this paper, we explore a novel 3D AIGC approach: generating 3D\ncontent from IDEAs. An IDEA is a multimodal input composed of text, image, and\n3D models. To our knowledge, this challenging and exciting 3D AIGC setting has\nnot been studied before. We propose the new framework Idea23D, which combines\nthree agents based on large multimodal models (LMMs) and existing algorithmic\ntools. These three LMM-based agents are tasked with prompt generation, model\nselection, and feedback reflection. They collaborate and critique each other in\na fully automated loop, without human intervention. The framework then\ngenerates a text prompt to create 3D models that align closely with the input\nIDEAs. We demonstrate impressive 3D AIGC results that surpass previous methods.\nTo comprehensively assess the 3D AIGC capabilities of Idea23D, we introduce the\nEval3DAIGC-198 dataset, containing 198 multimodal inputs for 3D generation\ntasks. This dataset evaluates the alignment between generated 3D content and\ninput IDEAs. Our user study and quantitative results show that Idea23D\nsignificantly improves the success rate and accuracy of 3D generation, with\nexcellent compatibility across various LMM, Text-to-Image, and Image-to-3D\nmodels.

In particular, LLaMA3 models have recently been released\nand have achieved impressive performance in various domains with super-large\nscale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of\nlow-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios, we explore\nLLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration can\npotentially provide new insights and challenges for the low-bit quantization of\nLLaMA3 and other future LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation\nissues that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we comprehensively\nevaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA fine-tuning\n(LoRA-FT) methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and various datasets to reveal the\nlow-bit quantization performance of LLaMA3. To uncover the capabilities of\nlow-bit quantized MLLM, we assessed the performance of the LLaMA3-based\nLLaVA-Next-8B model under 2-4 ultra-low bits with post-training quantization\nmethods. Our experimental results indicate that LLaMA3 still suffers from\nnon-negligible degradation in linguistic and visual contexts, particularly\nunder ultra-low bit widths. This highlights the significant performance gap at\nlow bit-width that needs to be addressed in future developments. We expect that\nthis empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, driving\nLLMs and MLLMs to achieve higher accuracy at lower bit to enhance practicality.\nOur project is released on https://github.com/Macaronlin/LLaMA3-Quantization ,\nand quantized models are released at https://huggingface.co/Efficient-ML .",

Our experimental\nresults indicate that LLMs with 4-bit quantization can retain performance\ncomparable to their non-quantized counterparts, and perplexity can serve as a\nproxy metric for quantized LLMs on most benchmarks. Furthermore, quantized LLMs\nwith larger parameter scales can outperform smaller LLMs. Despite the memory\nsavings achieved through quantization, it can also slow down the inference\nspeed of LLMs. Consequently, substantial engineering efforts and hardware\nsupport are imperative to achieve a balanced optimization of decoding speed and\nmemory consumption in the context of quantized LLMs.",

However, they face challenges in\nmanaging their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware\ntraining (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit\nrepresentations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to\nsubstantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient\nQuantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm.\nEfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all\nparameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters\n(E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable\ndirect training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy\nloss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization.\nE2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end,\nfurther improving the performance of quantized models by considering\ninteractions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nEfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of\nmodels, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with\nscales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance,\nEfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41\nhours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full\nprecision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

To address these challenges, we propose MotionCharacter, an\nefficient and high-fidelity human video generation framework designed for\nidentity preservation and fine-grained motion control. We introduce an\nID-preserving module to maintain identity fidelity while allowing flexible\nattribute modifications, and further integrate ID-consistency and region-aware\nloss mechanisms, significantly enhancing identity consistency and detail\nfidelity. Additionally, our approach incorporates a motion control module that\nprioritizes action-related text while maintaining subject consistency, along\nwith a dataset, Human-Motion, which utilizes large language models to generate\ndetailed motion descriptions. For simplify user control during inference, we\nparameterize motion intensity through a single coefficient, allowing for easy\nadjustments.

ID-Animator inherits existing\ndiffusion-based video generation backbones with a face adapter to encode the\nID-relevant embeddings from learnable facial latent queries. To facilitate the\nextraction of identity information in video generation, we introduce an\nID-oriented dataset construction pipeline that incorporates unified human\nattributes and action captioning techniques from a constructed facial image\npool. Based on this pipeline, a random reference training strategy is further\ndevised to precisely capture the ID-relevant embeddings with an ID-preserving\nloss, thus improving the fidelity and generalization capacity of our model for\nID-specific video generation.

In diffusion-based T2V models, the attention mechanism is a\ncritical component. However, it remains unclear what intermediate features are\nlearned and how attention blocks in T2V models affect various aspects of video\nsynthesis, such as image quality and temporal consistency. In this paper, we\nconduct an in-depth perturbation analysis of the spatial and temporal attention\nblocks of T2V models using an information-theoretic approach. Our results\nindicate that temporal and spatial attention maps affect not only the timing\nand layout of the videos but also the complexity of spatiotemporal elements and\nthe aesthetic quality of the synthesized videos. Notably, high-entropy\nattention maps are often key elements linked to superior video quality, whereas\nlow-entropy attention maps are associated with the video's intra-frame\nstructure. Based on our findings, we propose two novel methods to enhance video\nquality and enable text-guided video editing.

To address these challenges, we propose MotionCharacter, an\nefficient and high-fidelity human video generation framework designed for\nidentity preservation and fine-grained motion control. We introduce an\nID-preserving module to maintain identity fidelity while allowing flexible\nattribute modifications, and further integrate ID-consistency and region-aware\nloss mechanisms, significantly enhancing identity consistency and detail\nfidelity. Additionally, our approach incorporates a motion control module that\nprioritizes action-related text while maintaining subject consistency, along\nwith a dataset, Human-Motion, which utilizes large language models to generate\ndetailed motion descriptions. For simplify user control during inference, we\nparameterize motion intensity through a single coefficient, allowing for easy\nadjustments. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of\nMotionCharacter, demonstrating significant improvements in ID-preserving,\nhigh-quality video generation.",

A traditional method for video\ncustomization that is tuning-free often relies on large, annotated video\ndatasets, which are computationally expensive and require extensive annotation.\nIn contrast to the previous approach, we introduce the use of an image\ncustomization dataset directly on training video customization models,\nfactorizing the video customization into two folds: (1) identity injection\nthrough image customization dataset and (2) temporal modeling preservation with\na small set of unannotated videos through the image-to-video training method.\nAdditionally, we employ random image token dropping with randomized image\ninitialization during image-to-video fine-tuning to mitigate the copy-and-paste\nissue. To further enhance learning, we introduce stochastic switching during\njoint optimization of subject-specific and temporal features, mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting.

To tackle this problem, we propose a two-stage framework\nconsisting of audio-to-landmark generation and landmark-to-video rendering\nprocedures. First, we devise a novel Transformer-based landmark generator to\ninfer lip and jaw landmarks from the audio. Prior landmark characteristics of\nthe speaker's face are employed to make the generated landmarks coincide with\nthe facial outline of the speaker. Then, a video rendering model is built to\ntranslate the generated landmarks into face images. During this stage, prior\nappearance information is extracted from the lower-half occluded target face\nand static reference images, which helps generate realistic and\nidentity-preserving visual content. For effectively exploring the prior\ninformation of static reference images, we align static reference images with\nthe target face's pose and expression based on motion fields. Moreover,\nauditory features are reused to guarantee that the generated face images are\nwell synchronized with the audio.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof ID-Animator to generate personalized human videos over previous models.\nMoreover, our method is highly compatible with popular pre-trained T2V models\nlike animatediff and various community backbone models, showing high\nextendability in real-world applications for video generation where identity\npreservation is highly desired.

Therefore, we present\nVersaAnimator, a versatile framework that synthesizes expressive talking human\nvideos from arbitrary portrait images. Specifically, we design a motion\ngenerator that produces basic rhythmic movements from audio input and supports\ntext-prompt control for specific actions. The generated whole-body 3D motion\ntokens can animate portraits of various scales, producing talking heads,\nhalf-body gestures and even leg movements for whole-body images. Besides, we\nintroduce a multi-modal controlled video diffusion that generates\nphotorealistic videos, where speech signals govern lip synchronization, facial\nexpressions, and head motions while body movements are guided by the 2D poses.\nFurthermore, we introduce a token2pose translator to smoothly map 3D motion\ntokens to 2D pose sequences. This design mitigates the stiffness resulting from\ndirect 3D to 2D conversion and enhances the details of the generated body\nmovements. Extensive experiments shows that VersaAnimator synthesizes\nlip-synced and identity-preserving videos while generating expressive and\nsemantically meaningful whole-body motions.",

Unlike traditional agents, large language\nmodel-based agents (LLM agents) have emerged as a promising paradigm for\nachieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their superior reasoning\nand generalization capabilities. Effective planning is crucial for the success\nof LLM agents in real-world tasks, making it a highly pursued topic in the\ncommunity. Current planning methods typically translate tasks into executable\naction sequences. However, determining a feasible or optimal sequence for\ncomplex tasks with multiple constraints at fine granularity, which often\nrequires compositing long chains of heterogeneous actions, remains challenging.\nThis paper introduces Planning with Multi-Constraints (PMC), a zero-shot\nmethodology for collaborative LLM-based multi-agent systems that simplifies\ncomplex task planning with constraints by decomposing it into a hierarchy of\nsubordinate tasks. Each subtask is then mapped into executable actions. PMC was\nassessed on two constraint-intensive benchmarks, TravelPlanner and API-Bank.\nNotably, PMC achieved an average 42.68% success rate on TravelPlanner,\nsignificantly higher than GPT-4 (2.92%), and outperforming GPT-4 with ReAct on\nAPI-Bank by 13.64%, showing the immense potential of integrating LLM with\nmulti-agent systems.

Equipped with external tools that\nare designed for a specific purpose (e.g., for flight booking or an alarm\nclock), LLM agents exercise an increasing capability to assist humans in their\ndaily work. Although LLM agents have shown a promising blueprint as daily\nassistants, there is a limited understanding of how they can provide daily\nassistance based on planning and sequential decision making capabilities. We\ndraw inspiration from recent work that has highlighted the value of\n'LLM-modulo' setups in conjunction with humans-in-the-loop for planning tasks.\nWe conducted an empirical study (N = 248) of LLM agents as daily assistants in\nsix commonly occurring tasks with different levels of risk typically associated\nwith them (e.g., flight ticket booking and credit card payments). To ensure\nuser agency and control over the LLM agent, we adopted LLM agents in a\nplan-then-execute manner, wherein the agents conducted step-wise planning and\nstep-by-step execution in a simulation environment. We analyzed how user\ninvolvement at each stage affects their trust and collaborative team\nperformance. Our findings demonstrate that LLM agents can be a double-edged\nsword -- (1) they can work well when a high-quality plan and necessary user\ninvolvement in execution are available, and (2) users can easily mistrust the\nLLM agents with plans that seem plausible. We synthesized key insights for\nusing LLM agents as daily assistants to calibrate user trust and achieve better\noverall task outcomes. Our work has important implications for the future\ndesign of daily assistants and human-AI collaboration with LLM agents.",

To address this gap,\nwe present SafeAgentBench-the first benchmark for safety-aware task planning of\nembodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments. SafeAgentBench\nincludes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks,\nrigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2)\nSafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller,\nsupporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8\nstate-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both\nexecution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although\nagents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in\ntask success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most\nsafety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10\\% rejection rate for detailed\nhazardous tasks.

However, for planning tasks\nwith limited prior data (e.g., blocks world, advanced travel planning), the\nperformance of LLMs, including proprietary models like GPT and Gemini, is poor.\nThis paper investigates the impact of fine-tuning on the planning capabilities\nof LLMs, revealing that LLMs can achieve strong performance in planning through\nsubstantial (tens of thousands of specific examples) fine-tuning. Yet, this\nprocess incurs high economic, time, and computational costs for each planning\nproblem variation. To address this, we propose Clustering-Based Maximum\nDiversity Sampling (CMDS), which selects diverse and representative data to\nenhance sample efficiency and the model's generalization capability. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that CMDS-l, a baseline method combining CMDS with\nlanguage embeddings, outperforms random sampling.

As a classic machine learning task, time\nseries forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large\nlanguage models as \\emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further\nfine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some\nunexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting\nunder the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input\ntime series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with\ntraditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting\nproperties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study\nshows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and\ntrends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation\ncan be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period\nwithin datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input\nstrategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge\nand adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive\nperformance of LLMs for time series.

Two key components of learned image compression are the\nentropy model of the latent representations and the encoding/decoding network\narchitectures. Various models have been proposed, such as autoregressive,\nsoftmax, logistic mixture, Gaussian mixture, and Laplacian. Existing schemes\nonly use one of these models. However, due to the vast diversity of images, it\nis not optimal to use one model for all images, even different regions within\none image. In this paper, we propose a more flexible discretized\nGaussian-Laplacian-Logistic mixture model (GLLMM) for the latent\nrepresentations, which can adapt to different contents in different images and\ndifferent regions of one image more accurately and efficiently, given the same\ncomplexity. Besides, in the encoding/decoding network design part, we propose a\nconcatenated residual blocks (CRB), where multiple residual blocks are serially\nconnected with additional shortcut connections. The CRB can improve the\nlearning ability of the network, which can further improve the compression\nperformance. Experimental results using the Kodak, Tecnick-100 and Tecnick-40\ndatasets show that the proposed scheme outperforms all the leading\nlearning-based methods and existing compression standards including VVC intra\ncoding (4:4:4 and 4:2:0) in terms of the PSNR and MS-SSIM.

            "abstract": "Prototypical-part methods, e.g., ProtoPNet, enhance interpretability in image\nrecognition by linking predictions to training prototypes, thereby offering\nintuitive insights into their decision-making. Existing methods, which rely on\na point-based learning of prototypes, typically face two critical issues: 1)\nthe learned prototypes have limited representation power and are not suitable\nto detect Out-of-Distribution (OoD) inputs, reducing their decision\ntrustworthiness; and 2) the necessary projection of the learned prototypes back\ninto the space of training images causes a drastic degradation in the\npredictive performance. Furthermore, current prototype learning adopts an\naggressive approach that considers only the most active object parts during\ntraining, while overlooking sub-salient object regions which still hold crucial\nclassification information. In this paper, we present a new generative paradigm\nto learn prototype distributions, termed as Mixture of Gaussian-distributed\nPrototypes (MGProto). The distribution of prototypes from MGProto enables both\ninterpretable image classification and trustworthy recognition of OoD inputs.\nThe optimisation of MGProto naturally projects the learned prototype\ndistributions back into the training image space, thereby addressing the\nperformance degradation caused by prototype projection. Additionally, we\ndevelop a novel and effective prototype mining strategy that considers not only\nthe most active but also sub-salient object parts. To promote model\ncompactness, we further propose to prune MGProto by removing prototypes with\nlow importance priors.

As in many tasks\nsufficient pixel-level labels are very difficult to obtain, we propose a method\nwhich combines a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with unsupervised deep learning\ntechniques. In the standard GMM the pixel values with each sub-region are\nmodelled by a Gaussian distribution. In order to identify the different\nregions, the parameter vector that minimizes the negative log-likelihood (NLL)\nfunction regarding the GMM has to be approximated. For this task, usually\niterative optimization methods such as the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm are used. In this paper, we propose to estimate these parameters\ndirectly from the image using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We thus\nchange the iterative procedure in the EM algorithm replacing the\nexpectation-step by a gradient-step with regard to the networks parameters.\nThis means that the network is trained to minimize the NLL function of the GMM\nwhich comes with at least two advantages. As once trained, the network is able\nto predict label probabilities very quickly compared with time consuming\niterative optimization methods. Secondly, due to the deep image prior our\nmethod is able to partially overcome one of the main disadvantages of GMM,\nwhich is not taking into account correlation between neighboring pixels, as it\nassumes independence between them. We demonstrate the advantages of our method\nin various experiments on the example of myocardial infarct segmentation on\nmulti-sequence MRI images.",

It encodes a transformed latent\nrepresentation using a static distribution whose parameters are learned during\ntraining. However, the actual distribution of the latent data may vary wildly\nacross different inputs. The static distribution attempts to encompass all\npossible input distributions, thus fitting none of them particularly well. This\nunfortunate phenomenon, sometimes known as the amortization gap, results in\nsuboptimal compression. To address this issue, we propose a method that\ndynamically adapts the encoding distribution to match the latent data\ndistribution for a specific input. First, our model estimates a better encoding\ndistribution for a given input. This distribution is then compressed and\ntransmitted as an additional side-information bitstream. Finally, the decoder\nreconstructs the encoding distribution and uses it to decompress the\ncorresponding latent data. Our method achieves a Bj{\\o}ntegaard-Delta (BD)-rate\ngain of -7.10% on the Kodak test dataset when applied to the standard\nfully-factorized architecture. Furthermore, considering computational\ncomplexity, the transform used by our method is an order of magnitude cheaper\nin terms of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations compared to related\nside-information methods such as the scale hyperprior.",

Unfortunately, SDS has a number of characteristic artifacts\nthat limit its usefulness in general-purpose applications. In this paper, we\nmake progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by\nviewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from a source\ndistribution to a target distribution. Under this new interpretation, these\nmethods seek to transport corrupted images (source) to the natural image\ndistribution (target). We argue that current methods' characteristic artifacts\nare caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor\nestimates of the source distribution. We show that calibrating the text\nconditioning of the source distribution can produce high-quality generation and\ntranslation results with little extra overhead. Our method can be easily\napplied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized\nmethods. We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-based NeRF\noptimization, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion\ngeneration, and 3D sketch-to-real. We compare our method to existing approaches\nfor score distillation sampling and show that it can produce high-frequency\ndetails with realistic colors.",

It begins by\nexamining the mechanisms behind LLMs, emphasizing their ability to comprehend\nand generate human-like text. The chapter then discusses methodologies for\ncreating diverse, contextually relevant questions, enhancing learning through\ntailored, adaptive strategies. Key prompting techniques, such as zero-shot and\nchain-of-thought prompting, are evaluated for their effectiveness in generating\nhigh-quality questions, including open-ended and multiple-choice formats in\nvarious languages.

However, there is still a lack of\ndatasets to conduct large-scale evaluations of personalized IR; this is mainly\ndue to the fact that collecting and curating high-quality user-related\ninformation requires significant costs and time investment. Furthermore, the\ncreation of datasets for Personalized IR (PIR) tasks is affected by both\nprivacy concerns and the need for accurate user-related data, which are often\nnot publicly available. Recently, researchers have started to explore the use\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets, which is a\npossible solution to generate data for low-resource tasks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating\nsynthetic documents to train an IR system for a Personalized Community Question\nAnswering task. To study the effectiveness of IR models fine-tuned on\nLLM-generated data, we introduce a new dataset, named Sy-SE-PQA. We build\nSy-SE-PQA based on an existing dataset, SE-PQA, which consists of questions and\nanswers posted on the popular StackExchange communities. Starting from\nquestions in SE-PQA, we generate synthetic answers using different prompt\ntechniques and LLMs. Our findings suggest that LLMs have high potential in\ngenerating data tailored to users' needs.

This results in the homogenization of\nviewpoints and perspectives, as well as the underrepresentation of specific\ndemographic groups. Although several fine-tuning and prompting techniques have\nbeen suggested to tackle the issue, they are often tailored to specific tasks\nor come with a substantial increase in computational cost and latency. This\nmakes them challenging to apply to applications that demand very low latency,\nsuch as chatbots and virtual assistants. We propose Possibility Exploration\nFine-Tuning (PEFT), a task-agnostic framework that enhances the text diversity\nof LLMs without increasing latency or computational cost. Given the same\nprompt, models fine-tuned with PEFT can simultaneously generate multiple\ndiverse responses, each corresponding with a controllable possibility number.\nExperiments on dialogue and story generation tasks demonstrate that PEFT\nsignificantly enhances the diversity of LLM outputs, as evidenced by lower\nsimilarity between candidate responses. Since PEFT emphasizes semantic\ndiversity over lexical diversity, it can also notably reduce demographic bias\nin dialogue systems.

However, LLM post-training often focuses on\nimproving generation quality but neglects to facilitate output diversity.\nHence, in creative writing generation, we investigate post-training approaches\nto promote both output diversity and quality. Our core idea is to include\ndeviation -- the degree of difference between a training sample and all other\nsamples with the same prompt -- in the training objective to facilitate\nlearning from rare high-quality instances.

However, current approaches primarily enhance\nreasoning through the elaboration of thoughts while neglecting the diversity of\nreasoning types. LLMs typically employ deductive reasoning, proceeding\nstep-by-step from given conditions, which limits their exploration during\nproblem-solving. Our analysis reveals that certain problems are exclusively\nsolvable through specific reasoning strategies like inductive, abductive, or\nanalogical reasoning. However, incorporating diverse reasoning approaches\npresents two key challenges: identifying the appropriate reasoning type for\neach problem and exploiting this approach during problem-solving. Therefore, we\npropose the TypedThinker that predicts suitable reasoning types based on the\nproblem and their previous effectiveness and provides relevant demonstrations\nto guide LLMs in applying these strategies. Experimental results show\nsignificant improvements across multiple benchmarks, with performance gains of\n3.4% for Mistral 7B, 6.5% for LLaMA3 8B, and 7% for Qwen 2 7B on logical and\nmathematical reasoning tasks. TypedThinker enhances LLM reasoning without\nrequiring knowledge distillation from larger models.

However, we argue\nthat language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most\nword tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for\nreasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge\nchallenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an\nunrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new\nparadigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden\nstate of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed \"continuous\nthought\"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the\nLLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.\nExperiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several\nreasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent\nadvanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple\nalternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a\nsingle deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical\nreasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with\nfewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise\nof latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.",

We address these\nchallenges by proposing EfQAT, which generalizes both schemes by optimizing\nonly a subset of the parameters of a quantized model. EfQAT starts by applying\na PTQ scheme to a pre-trained model and only updates the most critical network\nparameters while freezing the rest, accelerating the backward pass. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of EfQAT on various CNNs and Transformer-based\nmodels using different GPUs. Specifically, we show that EfQAT is significantly\nmore accurate than PTQ with little extra compute. Furthermore, EfQAT can\naccelerate the QAT backward pass between 1.44-1.64x while retaining most\naccuracy.",

To address the heavy computation and parameter\ndrawbacks, quantization is frequently studied in the community as a\nrepresentative model compression technique and has seen extensive use on\nConvNets. However, due to the unique properties of transformers, the low-bit\nquantization applications are still limited and underexplored. In this paper,\nwe identify the difficulty of transformer low-bit quantization-aware training\non its unique variation behaviors, which significantly differ from ConvNets.\nBased on comprehensive quantitative analysis, we observe variation in three\nhierarchies: various module quantization sensitivities, outliers in static\nweight and activation distribution, and oscillation in dynamic parameter\nfluctuations. These variations of transformers bring instability to the\nquantization-aware training (QAT) and negatively influence the performance.

The low-precision model exhibits limited\nrepresentation capabilities and cannot directly replicate full-precision\ncalculations, which constitutes a deficiency compared to full-precision\nalternatives; 2. Non-ideal deviations during gradient propagation are a common\nconsequence of employing pseudo-gradients as approximations in derived\nquantized functions. In this paper, we propose a general QAT framework for\nalleviating the aforementioned concerns by permitting the forward and backward\nprocesses of the low-precision network to be guided by the full-precision\npartner during training. In conjunction with the direct training of the\nquantization model, intermediate mixed-precision models are generated through\nthe block-by-block replacement on the full-precision model and working\nsimultaneously with the low-precision backbone, which enables the integration\nof quantized low-precision blocks into full-precision networks throughout the\ntraining phase.

Our experiments on benchmark\nlanguage models from the LLaMA family show that our proposed approach boosts\naccuracy and tightens the gap between the quantized model and the\nfull-precision model, with minimal overhead. Our method will be made publicly\navailable to facilitate future developments in ultra-low-bit quantization of\nlarge language models.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image synthesis\nand related generative tasks. Nevertheless, their practicality for real-world\napplications is constrained by substantial computational costs and latency\nissues. Quantization is a dominant way to compress and accelerate diffusion\nmodels, where post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training\n(QAT) are two main approaches, each bearing its own properties. While PTQ\nexhibits efficiency in terms of both time and data usage, it may lead to\ndiminished performance in low bit-width. On the other hand, QAT can alleviate\nperformance degradation but comes with substantial demands on computational and\ndata resources. In this paper, we introduce a data-free and parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning framework for low-bit diffusion models, dubbed EfficientDM, to\nachieve QAT-level performance with PTQ-like efficiency. Specifically, we\npropose a quantization-aware variant of the low-rank adapter (QALoRA) that can\nbe merged with model weights and jointly quantized to low bit-width. The\nfine-tuning process distills the denoising capabilities of the full-precision\nmodel into its quantized counterpart, eliminating the requirement for training\ndata. We also introduce scale-aware optimization and temporal learned step-size\nquantization to further enhance performance. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous PTQ-based\ndiffusion models while maintaining similar time and data efficiency.\nSpecifically, there is only a 0.05 sFID increase when quantizing both weights\nand activations of LDM-4 to 4-bit on ImageNet 256x256. Compared to QAT-based\nmethods, our EfficientDM also boasts a 16.2x faster quantization speed with\ncomparable generation quality.

Several existing sub 2-bit\npost-training quantization (PTQ) methods utilize a mix-precision scheme by\nleveraging an unstructured fine-grained mask to explicitly distinguish salient\nweights, while which introduces an extra 1-bit or more per weight. To explore\nthe real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called\nPTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with\nnegligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the\nperspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate\ncorresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit. For non-salient channels\nbinarization, an efficient block-wise scaling factors optimization framework is\nthen presented to take implicit row-wise correlations and angular biases into\naccount. Different from prior works that concentrate on adjusting quantization\nmethodologies, we further propose a novel paradigm called quantization\npreprocessing, where we argue that transforming the weight distribution of the\npretrained model before quantization can alleviate the difficulty in\nper-channel extremely low-bit PTQ.

To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation\nstrategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation,\nQuestion Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs\ntrained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query\nbudget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across\nsettings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the\nratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed\ninstruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing\nquestions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new\nquestions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of\naugmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low\nto mid data regimes than in high data regimes.

Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to\nunlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios.\nSeveral alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or\nhybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear,\nespecially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily\nverified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation\nstrategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation,\nQuestion Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs\ntrained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query\nbudget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across\nsettings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the\nratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed\ninstruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing\nquestions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new\nquestions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of\naugmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low\nto mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework\nfor selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into\naccount additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the\nimportance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for\nsynthetic data generation.",

Through supervised\nfine-tuning, preference optimization, and self-improvement, SPEED enables small\nopen-source models to produce high-quality data. Remarkably, SPEED uses only\nless than 1/10 of the GPT API calls, outperforming the state-of-the-art\nembedding model E5_mistral when both are trained solely on their synthetic\ndata.

Given this\nvariety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are\nscarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what\nbottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of\nsynthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity,\nand complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in\nopen-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream\nmodels. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model\ngeneralization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize\nthe existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the\ndownstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various\ncomponents in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This\nexamination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation\nalgorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on\ndata QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance\nof balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and\nself-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data,\noften there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity\nwhich impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are\ncurrently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting\noutput diversity and the potential for self-improvement. We argue that\nbalancing these trade-offs is essential to the development of future\nself-improvement algorithms and highlight a number of works making progress in\nthis direction.",

To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation\nstrategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation,\nQuestion Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs\ntrained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query\nbudget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across\nsettings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the\nratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed\ninstruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing\nquestions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new\nquestions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of\naugmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low\nto mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework\nfor selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into\naccount additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the\nimportance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for\nsynthetic data generation.",

However, the model size and performance of these long context\nmodels are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and\ninference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long\ninputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented\nGeneration (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the\ninput, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.\nThe core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,\nwhich does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest\nscores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this\nfrustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page\ndocuments using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,\nLLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG\nconsistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,\nFRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on\nVideo-MME.

However, when the visual input changes from a single\nimage to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the\nvast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of\nMLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon\nsampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key\ninformation to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers. This paper presents\na simple yet effective algorithm named Adaptive Keyframe Sampling (AKS). It\ninserts a plug-and-play module known as keyframe selection, which aims to\nmaximize the useful information with a fixed number of video tokens. We\nformulate keyframe selection as an optimization involving (1) the relevance\nbetween the keyframes and the prompt, and (2) the coverage of the keyframes\nover the video, and present an adaptive algorithm to approximate the best\nsolution. Experiments on two long video understanding benchmarks validate that\nAdaptive Keyframe Sampling improves video QA accuracy (beyond strong baselines)\nupon selecting informative keyframes. Our study reveals the importance of\ninformation pre-filtering in video-based MLLMs. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ncTimTang/AKS.",

However, the model size and performance of these long context\nmodels are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and\ninference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long\ninputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented\nGeneration (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the\ninput, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.\nThe core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,\nwhich does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest\nscores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this\nfrustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page\ndocuments using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,\nLLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG\nconsistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances for both long video and long document understanding.

However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy\nvisual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context\nlength cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant\nframes hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial.\nThis paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles:\nquery relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such\nas uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these\nprinciples. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with\ndynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and\nmodel-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nVideo-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the\nquery using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the\nsimilarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To\nincorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each\nsegment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov\ndecision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments.\nTheoretically, MDP3 provides a \\((1 - 1/e)\\)-approximate solution to the\nNP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time\ncomplexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly\noutperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.",

The discovery of functionally promising mutations is challenged by the\nlimited evolutionary accessible regions, i.e., only a small region on the\nfitness landscape is beneficial. There have been numerous priors used to\nconstrain protein evolution to regions of landscapes with high-fitness\nvariants, among which the change in binding free energy (DDG) of protein\ncomplexes upon mutations is one of the most commonly used priors. However, the\nhuge mutation space poses two challenges: (1) how to improve the efficiency of\nDDG prediction for fast mutation screening; and (2) how to explain mutation\npreferences and efficiently explore accessible evolutionary regions. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a lightweight DDG predictor (Light-DDG), which\nadopts a structure-aware Transformer as the backbone and enhances it by\nknowledge distilled from existing powerful but computationally heavy DDG\npredictors. Additionally, we augmented, annotated, and released a large-scale\ndataset containing millions of mutation data for pre-training Light-DDG. We\nfind that such a simple yet effective Light-DDG can serve as a good\nunsupervised antibody optimizer and explainer. For the target antibody, we\npropose a novel Mutation Explainer to learn mutation preferences, which\naccounts for the marginal benefit of each mutation per residue. To further\nexplore accessible evolutionary regions, we conduct preference-guided antibody\noptimization and evaluate antibody candidates quickly using Light-DDG to\nidentify desirable mutations.",

While many deep learning methods have\nbeen developed for general protein binding site prediction tasks, whether they\nwork for epitope prediction remains an understudied research question. The\nchallenge is also heightened by the lack of a consistent evaluation pipeline\nwith sufficient dataset size and epitope diversity. We introduce a filtered\nantibody-antigen complex structure dataset, AsEP (Antibody-specific Epitope\nPrediction). AsEP is the largest of its kind and provides clustered epitope\ngroups, allowing the community to develop and test novel epitope prediction\nmethods and evaluate their generalisability. AsEP comes with an easy-to-use\ninterface in Python and pre-built graph representations of each\nantibody-antigen complex while also supporting customizable embedding methods.\nUsing this new dataset, we benchmark several representative general\nprotein-binding site prediction methods and find that their performances fall\nshort of expectations for epitope prediction. To address this, we propose a\nnovel method, WALLE, which leverages both unstructured modeling from protein\nlanguage models and structural modeling from graph neural networks. WALLE\ndemonstrate up to 3-10X performance improvement over the baseline methods. Our\nempirical findings suggest that epitope prediction benefits from combining\nsequential features provided by language models with geometrical information\nfrom graph representations. This provides a guideline for future epitope\nprediction method design.

While\nlarge language models (LLMs) have achieved much progress in the domain of\nnatural language processing, their potential in protein engineering remains\nlargely unexplored. Previous approaches have equipped LLMs with protein\nunderstanding capabilities by incorporating external protein encoders, but this\nfails to fully leverage the inherent similarities between protein sequences and\nnatural languages, resulting in sub-optimal performance and increased model\ncomplexity. To address this gap, we present TourSynbio-7B, the first\nmulti-modal large model specifically designed for protein engineering tasks\nwithout external protein encoders. TourSynbio-7B demonstrates that LLMs can\ninherently learn to understand proteins as language. The model is post-trained\nand instruction fine-tuned on InternLM2-7B using ProteinLMDataset, a dataset\ncomprising 17.46 billion tokens of text and protein sequence for\nself-supervised pretraining and 893K instructions for supervised fine-tuning.\nTourSynbio-7B outperforms GPT-4 on the ProteinLMBench, a benchmark of 944\nmanually verified multiple-choice questions, with 62.18% accuracy. Leveraging\nTourSynbio-7B's enhanced protein sequence understanding capability, we\nintroduce TourSynbio-Agent, an innovative framework capable of performing\nvarious protein engineering tasks, including mutation analysis, inverse\nfolding, protein folding, and visualization. TourSynbio-Agent integrates\npreviously disconnected deep learning models in the protein engineering domain,\noffering a unified conversational user interface for improved usability.\nFinally, we demonstrate the efficacy of TourSynbio-7B and TourSynbio-Agent\nthrough two wet lab case studies on vanilla key enzyme modification and steroid\ncompound catalysis.",

We introduce Clone-informed Bayesian Optimization (CloneBO), a\nBayesian optimization procedure that efficiently optimizes antibodies in the\nlab by teaching a generative model how our immune system optimizes antibodies.\nOur immune system makes antibodies by iteratively evolving specific portions of\ntheir sequences to bind their target strongly and stably, resulting in a set of\nrelated, evolving sequences known as a clonal family. We train a large language\nmodel, CloneLM, on hundreds of thousands of clonal families and use it to\ndesign sequences with mutations that are most likely to optimize an antibody\nwithin the human immune system. We propose to guide our designs to fit previous\nmeasurements with a twisted sequential Monte Carlo procedure.

            "abstract": "The structural similarities between protein sequences and natural languages\nhave led to parallel advancements in deep learning across both domains. While\nlarge language models (LLMs) have achieved much progress in the domain of\nnatural language processing, their potential in protein engineering remains\nlargely unexplored. Previous approaches have equipped LLMs with protein\nunderstanding capabilities by incorporating external protein encoders, but this\nfails to fully leverage the inherent similarities between protein sequences and\nnatural languages, resulting in sub-optimal performance and increased model\ncomplexity. To address this gap, we present TourSynbio-7B, the first\nmulti-modal large model specifically designed for protein engineering tasks\nwithout external protein encoders. TourSynbio-7B demonstrates that LLMs can\ninherently learn to understand proteins as language. The model is post-trained\nand instruction fine-tuned on InternLM2-7B using ProteinLMDataset, a dataset\ncomprising 17.46 billion tokens of text and protein sequence for\nself-supervised pretraining and 893K instructions for supervised fine-tuning.\nTourSynbio-7B outperforms GPT-4 on the ProteinLMBench, a benchmark of 944\nmanually verified multiple-choice questions, with 62.18% accuracy. Leveraging\nTourSynbio-7B's enhanced protein sequence understanding capability, we\nintroduce TourSynbio-Agent, an innovative framework capable of performing\nvarious protein engineering tasks, including mutation analysis, inverse\nfolding, protein folding, and visualization. TourSynbio-Agent integrates\npreviously disconnected deep learning models in the protein engineering domain,\noffering a unified conversational user interface for improved usability.\nFinally, we demonstrate the efficacy of TourSynbio-7B and TourSynbio-Agent\nthrough two wet lab case studies on vanilla key enzyme modification and steroid\ncompound catalysis.",

            "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has recently arisen as a revolutionary approach to\ncollaborative training Machine Learning models. According to this novel\nframework, multiple participants train a global model collaboratively,\ncoordinating with a central aggregator without sharing their local data. As FL\ngains popularity in diverse domains, security, and privacy concerns arise due\nto the distributed nature of this solution. Therefore, integrating this\nstrategy with Blockchain technology has been consolidated as a preferred choice\nto ensure the privacy and security of participants.\n  This paper explores the research efforts carried out by the scientific\ncommunity to define privacy solutions in scenarios adopting Blockchain-Enabled\nFL. It comprehensively summarizes the background related to FL and Blockchain,\nevaluates existing architectures for their integration, and the primary attacks\nand possible countermeasures to guarantee privacy in this setting. Finally, it\nreviews the main application scenarios where Blockchain-Enabled FL approaches\nhave been proficiently applied. This survey can help academia and industry\npractitioners understand which theories and techniques exist to improve the\nperformance of FL through Blockchain to preserve privacy and which are the main\nchallenges and future directions in this novel and still under-explored\ncontext. We believe this work provides a novel contribution respect to the\nprevious surveys and is a valuable tool to explore the current landscape,\nunderstand perspectives, and pave the way for advancements or improvements in\nthis amalgamation of Blockchain and Federated Learning.",

Usually, a well-performing ML model relies on a large\nvolume of training data and high-powered computational resources. Such a need\nfor and the use of huge volumes of data raise serious privacy concerns because\nof the potential risks of leakage of highly privacy-sensitive information;\nfurther, the evolving regulatory environments that increasingly restrict access\nto and use of privacy-sensitive data add significant challenges to fully\nbenefiting from the power of ML for data-driven applications. A trained ML\nmodel may also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as membership,\nattribute, or property inference attacks and model inversion attacks. Hence,\nwell-designed privacy-preserving ML (PPML) solutions are critically needed for\nmany emerging applications. Increasingly, significant research efforts from\nboth academia and industry can be seen in PPML areas that aim toward\nintegrating privacy-preserving techniques into ML pipeline or specific\nalgorithms, or designing various PPML architectures. In particular, existing\nPPML research cross-cut ML, systems and applications design, as well as\nsecurity and privacy areas; hence, there is a critical need to understand\nstate-of-the-art research, related challenges and a research roadmap for future\nresearch in PPML area. In this paper, we systematically review and summarize\nexisting privacy-preserving approaches and propose a Phase, Guarantee, and\nUtility (PGU) triad based model to understand and guide the evaluation of\nvarious PPML solutions by decomposing their privacy-preserving functionalities.\nWe discuss the unique characteristics and challenges of PPML and outline\npossible research directions that leverage as well as benefit multiple research\ncommunities such as ML, distributed systems, security and privacy.",

These\nchallenges are particularly pronounced when models are trained and deployed on\ncloud platforms or third-party servers due to the computational resource\nlimitations of users' end devices. In response, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)\ntechnology has emerged as a promising solution, enabling effective validation\nof model performance and authenticity in both training and inference processes\nwithout disclosing sensitive data. Thus, ZKP ensures the verifiability and\nsecurity of machine learning models, making it a valuable tool for\nprivacy-preserving AI. Although some research has explored the verifiable\nmachine learning solutions that exploit ZKP, a comprehensive survey and summary\nof these efforts remain absent. This survey paper aims to bridge this gap by\nreviewing and analyzing all the existing Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML)\nresearch from June 2017 to December 2024. We begin by introducing the concept\nof ZKML and outlining its ZKP algorithmic setups under three key categories:\nverifiable training, verifiable inference, and verifiable testing. Next, we\nprovide a comprehensive categorization of existing ZKML research within these\ncategories and analyze the works in detail. Furthermore, we explore the\nimplementation challenges faced in this field and discuss the improvement works\nto address these obstacles.

We propose two novel applications of ML algorithms that can be\napplied in a known plaintext setting to perform cryptanalysis on any\ncryptosystem. We use mutual information neural estimation to calculate a\ncryptosystem's mutual information leakage, and a binary cross entropy\nclassification to model an indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack\n(CPA). These algorithms can be readily applied in an audit setting to evaluate\nthe robustness of a cryptosystem and the results can provide a useful empirical\nbound. We evaluate the efficacy of our methodologies by empirically analyzing\nseveral encryption schemes. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to novel\nnetwork coding-based cryptosystems and provide other use cases for our\nalgorithms. We show that our classification model correctly identifies the\nencryption schemes that are not IND-CPA secure, such as DES, RSA, and AES ECB,\nwith high accuracy. It also identifies the faults in CPA-secure cryptosystems\nwith faulty parameters, such a reduced counter version of AES-CTR.

It explores the balance between data\nprivacy and model utility, shedding light on privacy-preserving techniques that\nleverage cryptographic methods, Differential Privacy, and Trusted Execution\nEnvironments. The discussion extends to the application of these techniques in\nsensitive domains, underscoring the critical role of PPML in ensuring the\nprivacy and security of ML systems.",

Usually, a well-performing ML model relies on a large\nvolume of training data and high-powered computational resources. Such a need\nfor and the use of huge volumes of data raise serious privacy concerns because\nof the potential risks of leakage of highly privacy-sensitive information;\nfurther, the evolving regulatory environments that increasingly restrict access\nto and use of privacy-sensitive data add significant challenges to fully\nbenefiting from the power of ML for data-driven applications. A trained ML\nmodel may also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as membership,\nattribute, or property inference attacks and model inversion attacks. Hence,\nwell-designed privacy-preserving ML (PPML) solutions are critically needed for\nmany emerging applications. Increasingly, significant research efforts from\nboth academia and industry can be seen in PPML areas that aim toward\nintegrating privacy-preserving techniques into ML pipeline or specific\nalgorithms, or designing various PPML architectures. In particular, existing\nPPML research cross-cut ML, systems and applications design, as well as\nsecurity and privacy areas; hence, there is a critical need to understand\nstate-of-the-art research, related challenges and a research roadmap for future\nresearch in PPML area.

To achieve greater control over generated results,\nresearchers introduce additional architectures, such as ControlNet, Adapters\nand ReferenceNet, to integrate conditioning controls. However, current\ncontrollable generation methods often require substantial additional\ncomputational resources, especially for video generation, and face challenges\nin training or exhibit weak control. In this paper, we propose ControlNeXt: a\npowerful and efficient method for controllable image and video generation. We\nfirst design a more straightforward and efficient architecture, replacing heavy\nadditional branches with minimal additional cost compared to the base model.\nSuch a concise structure also allows our method to seamlessly integrate with\nother LoRA weights, enabling style alteration without the need for additional\ntraining. As for training, we reduce up to 90% of learnable parameters compared\nto the alternatives. Furthermore, we propose another method called Cross\nNormalization (CN) as a replacement for Zero-Convolution' to achieve fast and\nstable training convergence. We have conducted various experiments with\ndifferent base models across images and videos, demonstrating the robustness of\nour method.",

To address this\nlimitation, we present MinT, a multi-event video generator with temporal\ncontrol. Our key insight is to bind each event to a specific period in the\ngenerated video, which allows the model to focus on one event at a time. To\nenable time-aware interactions between event captions and video tokens, we\ndesign a time-based positional encoding method, dubbed ReRoPE. This encoding\nhelps to guide the cross-attention operation. By fine-tuning a pre-trained\nvideo diffusion transformer on temporally grounded data, our approach produces\ncoherent videos with smoothly connected events. For the first time in the\nliterature, our model offers control over the timing of events in generated\nvideos.

This design enables the original temporal attention and the\ntrajectory attention to work in synergy, ensuring both precise motion control\nand new content generation capability, which is critical when the trajectory is\nonly partially available. Experiments on camera motion control for images and\nvideos demonstrate significant improvements in precision and long-range\nconsistency while maintaining high-quality generation.

Given an image observation and a language instruction,\nprevious work has generated video plans which are then converted to robot\ncontrols to be executed. However, a major bottleneck in leveraging video\ngeneration for control lies in the quality of the generated videos, which often\nsuffer from hallucinatory content and unrealistic physics, resulting in low\ntask success when control actions are extracted from the generated videos.\nWhile scaling up dataset and model size provides a partial solution,\nintegrating external feedback is both natural and essential for grounding video\ngeneration in the real world. With this observation, we propose VideoAgent for\nself-improving generated video plans based on external feedback. Instead of\ndirectly executing the generated video plan, VideoAgent first refines the\ngenerated video plans using a novel procedure which we call self-conditioning\nconsistency, allowing inference-time compute to be turned into better generated\nvideo plans. As the refined video plan is being executed, VideoAgent can\ncollect additional data from the environment to further improve video plan\ngeneration. Experiments in simulated robotic manipulation from MetaWorld and\niTHOR show that VideoAgent drastically reduces hallucination, thereby boosting\nsuccess rate of downstream manipulation tasks. We further illustrate that\nVideoAgent can effectively refine real-robot videos, providing an early\nindicator that robots can be an effective tool in grounding video generation in\nthe physical world.

            "abstract": "Crafting magic and illusions is one of the most thrilling aspects of\nfilmmaking, with visual effects (VFX) serving as the powerhouse behind\nunforgettable cinematic experiences. While recent advances in generative\nartificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video\nsynthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively\nunderexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX\ngeneration as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from\nuser-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images. Our work makes\ntwo primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video\ndataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual\ndescriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and\nstart-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet\neffective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion\nTransformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA\nadapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask\ncontrol module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized\nstart-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the\ntext encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace.\nExtensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and\ntemporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to\nevaluate the precision of temporal control. By bridging traditional VFX\ntechniques with generative approaches, VFX Creator unlocks new possibilities\nfor efficient and high-quality video effect generation, making advanced VFX\naccessible to a broader audience.",

Most existing\nmethods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting\nintricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control\nprecision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts,\nthus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts.\nSpecifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle\nstatic and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change\nproperty to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables,\nenabling independent control over motion and identity. To establish the\ntheoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the\nidentifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we\ndesign a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce\nthe minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the\ndimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional\nindependence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in\nfor GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video\ngeneration benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves\ngeneration quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.",

However, challenges remain in\napplying these models to 3D spatial interactions and managing data collection\ncosts. To address these issues, we propose the multimodal robotic manipulation\nmodel, RoboMM, along with the comprehensive dataset, RoboData. RoboMM enhances\n3D perception through camera parameters and occupancy supervision. Building on\nOpenFlamingo, it incorporates Modality-Isolation-Mask and multimodal decoder\nblocks, improving modality fusion and fine-grained perception. RoboData offers\nthe complete evaluation system by integrating several well-known datasets,\nachieving the first fusion of multi-view images, camera parameters, depth maps,\nand actions, and the space alignment facilitates comprehensive learning from\ndiverse robotic datasets. Equipped with RoboData and the unified physical\nspace, RoboMM is the generalist policy that enables simultaneous evaluation\nacross all tasks within multiple datasets, rather than focusing on limited\nselection of data or tasks. Its design significantly enhances robotic\nmanipulation performance, increasing the average sequence length on the CALVIN\nfrom 1.7 to 3.3 and ensuring cross-embodiment capabilities, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.",

With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene\nunderstanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric\nperceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured\nenvironments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty\nof surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception\ncapability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the\nintelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric\nmulti-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera,\nLiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable\ndynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther\nareas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named\nRoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception.

Although VLMs demonstrate great\npotential in robotic task planning, they suffer from challenges like\nhallucination, semantic complexity, and limited context. To handle such issues,\nthis paper proposes a multi-agent framework, i.e., GameVLM, to enhance the\ndecision-making process in robotic task planning. In this study, VLM-based\ndecision and expert agents are presented to conduct the task planning.\nSpecifically, decision agents are used to plan the task, and the expert agent\nis employed to evaluate these task plans.

In robotics, the integration of common-sense\nknowledge from LLMs into task and motion planning has drastically advanced the\nfield by unlocking unprecedented levels of context awareness.

To address these\nchallenges and improve plan feasibility and computational efficiency, we\nintroduce DELTA, a novel LLM-informed task planning approach. By using scene\ngraphs as environment representations within LLMs, DELTA achieves rapid\ngeneration of precise planning problem descriptions. To enhance planning\nperformance, DELTA decomposes long-term task goals with LLMs into an\nautoregressive sequence of sub-goals, enabling automated task planners to\nefficiently solve complex problems. In our extensive evaluation, we show that\nDELTA enables an efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline,\nachieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning\ntimes compared to the state of the art.

However, the success of learning and generalization heavily depends on\nthe quality of these demonstrations. Consistency is often used to indicate\nquality in LfD, yet the factors that define this consistency remain\nunderexplored. In this paper, we evaluate a comprehensive set of motion data\ncharacteristics to determine which consistency measures best predict learning\nperformance. By ensuring demonstration consistency prior to training, we\nenhance models' predictive accuracy and generalization to novel scenarios. We\nvalidate our approach with two user studies involving participants with diverse\nlevels of robotics expertise. In the first study (N = 24), users taught a PR2\nrobot to perform a button-pressing task in a constrained environment, while in\nthe second study (N = 30), participants trained a UR5 robot on a pick-and-place\ntask. Results show that demonstration consistency significantly impacts success\nrates in both learning and generalization, with 70% and 89% of task success\nrates in the two studies predicted using our consistency metrics. Moreover, our\nmetrics estimate generalized performance success rates with 76% and 91%\naccuracy. These findings suggest that our proposed measures provide an\nintuitive, practical way to assess demonstration data quality before training,\nwithout requiring expert data or algorithm-specific modifications. Our approach\noffers a systematic way to evaluate demonstration quality, addressing a\ncritical gap in LfD by formalizing consistency metrics that enhance the\nreliability of robot learning from human demonstrations.",

These factors, which\nfrequently influence trading behaviors, are critical elements in the quest for\nmaximizing investors' profits. Our work attempts to solve this problem through\nlarge language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system\ncalled StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading\nbehaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to\nevaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to\nanalyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent\navoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation\nsystems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging\nprior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate\ndifferent LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment\nthat closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading,\nincluding trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research\nexplores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior\nknowledge related to market data. The patterns identified through StockAgent\nsimulations provide valuable insights for LLM-based investment advice and stock\nrecommendation.

FinRobot employs a multi-agent Chain of Thought\n(CoT) system, integrating both quantitative and qualitative analyses to emulate\nthe comprehensive reasoning of a human analyst. The system is structured around\nthree specialized agents: the Data-CoT Agent, which aggregates diverse data\nsources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, which mimics\nan analysts reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT\nAgent, which synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and\nreport. FinRobot provides thorough company analysis supported by precise\nnumerical data, industry-appropriate valuation metrics, and realistic risk\nassessments. Its dynamically updatable data pipeline ensures that research\nremains timely and relevant, adapting seamlessly to new financial information.\nUnlike existing automated research tools, such as CapitalCube and Wright\nReports, FinRobot delivers insights comparable to those produced by major\nbrokerage firms and fundamental research vendors.

While Generative AI (GenAI) has\nattracted significant attention in this field, existing AI solutions often fall\nshort due to their narrow focus on technical factors and limited capacity for\ndiscretionary judgment. These limitations hinder their ability to adapt to new\ndata in real-time and accurately assess risks, which diminishes their practical\nvalue for investors.\n  This paper presents FinRobot, the first AI agent framework specifically\ndesigned for equity research. FinRobot employs a multi-agent Chain of Thought\n(CoT) system, integrating both quantitative and qualitative analyses to emulate\nthe comprehensive reasoning of a human analyst. The system is structured around\nthree specialized agents: the Data-CoT Agent, which aggregates diverse data\nsources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, which mimics\nan analysts reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT\nAgent, which synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and\nreport. FinRobot provides thorough company analysis supported by precise\nnumerical data, industry-appropriate valuation metrics, and realistic risk\nassessments. Its dynamically updatable data pipeline ensures that research\nremains timely and relevant, adapting seamlessly to new financial information.\nUnlike existing automated research tools, such as CapitalCube and Wright\nReports, FinRobot delivers insights comparable to those produced by major\nbrokerage firms and fundamental research vendors.

The open-source\nframework incorporates a persistent order book with market and limit orders,\npartial fills, dividends, and equilibrium clearing alongside agents with varied\nstrategies, information sets, and endowments. Agents submit standardized\ndecisions using structured outputs and function calls while expressing their\nreasoning in natural language. Three findings emerge: First, LLMs demonstrate\nconsistent strategy adherence and can function as value investors, momentum\ntraders, or market makers per their instructions. Second, market dynamics\nexhibit features of real financial markets, including price discovery, bubbles,\nunderreaction, and strategic liquidity provision. Third, the framework enables\nanalysis of LLMs' responses to varying market conditions, similar to partial\ndependence plots in machine-learning interpretability. The framework allows\nsimulating financial theories without closed-form solutions, creating\nexperimental designs that would be costly with human participants, and\nestablishing how prompts can generate correlated behaviors affecting market\nstability.",

The\nrapid integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), offers opportunities to enhance the equity rating\nprocess. This paper explores the application of LLMs to generate multi-horizon\nstock ratings by ingesting diverse datasets. Traditional stock rating methods\nrely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several\nchallenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed\nreactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs\nto improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings. Additionally, we\nassess the efficacy of using different data modalities with LLMs for the\nfinancial domain.\n  We utilize varied datasets comprising fundamental financial, market, and news\ndata from January 2022 to June 2024, along with GPT-4-32k (v0613) (with a\ntraining cutoff in Sep. 2021 to prevent information leakage). Our results show\nthat our benchmark method outperforms traditional stock rating methods when\nassessed by forward returns, specially when incorporating financial\nfundamentals. While integrating news data improves short-term performance,\nsubstituting detailed news summaries with sentiment scores reduces token use\nwithout loss of performance. In many cases, omitting news data entirely\nenhances performance by reducing bias.\n  Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large\namounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at\nthe stock rating prediction task. Our work provides a reproducible and\nefficient framework for generating accurate stock ratings, serving as a\ncost-effective alternative to traditional methods. Future work will extend to\nlonger timeframes, incorporate diverse data, and utilize newer models for\nenhanced insights.",

The\nrapid integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), offers opportunities to enhance the equity rating\nprocess. This paper explores the application of LLMs to generate multi-horizon\nstock ratings by ingesting diverse datasets. Traditional stock rating methods\nrely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several\nchallenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed\nreactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs\nto improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings. Additionally, we\nassess the efficacy of using different data modalities with LLMs for the\nfinancial domain.\n  We utilize varied datasets comprising fundamental financial, market, and news\ndata from January 2022 to June 2024, along with GPT-4-32k (v0613) (with a\ntraining cutoff in Sep. 2021 to prevent information leakage). Our results show\nthat our benchmark method outperforms traditional stock rating methods when\nassessed by forward returns, specially when incorporating financial\nfundamentals. While integrating news data improves short-term performance,\nsubstituting detailed news summaries with sentiment scores reduces token use\nwithout loss of performance. In many cases, omitting news data entirely\nenhances performance by reducing bias.\n  Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large\namounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at\nthe stock rating prediction task. Our work provides a reproducible and\nefficient framework for generating accurate stock ratings, serving as a\ncost-effective alternative to traditional methods. Future work will extend to\nlonger timeframes, incorporate diverse data, and utilize newer models for\nenhanced insights.",

Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have brought new ways to improve these predictions. While recent\nfinancial large language models (FinLLMs) have shown considerable progress in\nfinancial NLP tasks compared to smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs),\nchallenges persist in stock price forecasting. Firstly, effectively integrating\nthe modalities of time series data and natural language to fully leverage these\ncapabilities remains complex. Secondly, FinLLMs focus more on analysis and\ninterpretability, which can overlook the essential features of time series\ndata. Moreover, due to the abundance of false and redundant information in\nfinancial markets, models often produce less accurate predictions when faced\nwith such input data. In this paper, we introduce StockTime, a novel LLM-based\narchitecture designed specifically for stock price data. Unlike recent FinLLMs,\nStockTime is specifically designed for stock price time series data. It\nleverages the natural ability of LLMs to predict the next token by treating\nstock prices as consecutive tokens, extracting textual information such as\nstock correlations, statistical trends and timestamps directly from these stock\nprices. StockTime then integrates both textual and time series data into the\nembedding space. By fusing this multimodal data, StockTime effectively predicts\nstock prices across arbitrary look-back periods. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat StockTime outperforms recent LLMs, as it gives more accurate predictions\nwhile reducing memory usage and runtime costs.",

Second, the feature effectiveness\nis dynamic with market variation, which affects both the stock sequential\npatterns and their correlations. To address the limitations, this paper\nintroduces MASTER, a MArkert-Guided Stock TransformER, which models the\nmomentary and cross-time stock correlation and leverages market information for\nautomatic feature selection.

In practice,\nthe key challenge lies in constructing a reliable time series forecasting model\ncapable of harnessing data from diverse sources and extracting valuable\ninsights to predict the target time series accurately. In this work, we tackle\nthis challenging problem and introduce a novel multimodal transformer-based\nmodel named the \\textit{Modality-aware Transformer}. Our model excels in\nexploring the power of both categorical text and numerical timeseries to\nforecast the target time series effectively while providing insights through\nits neural attention mechanism. To achieve this, we develop feature-level\nattention layers that encourage the model to focus on the most relevant\nfeatures within each data modality. By incorporating the proposed feature-level\nattention, we develop a novel Intra-modal multi-head attention (MHA),\nInter-modal MHA and Target-modal MHA in a way that both feature and temporal\nattentions are incorporated in MHAs. This enables the MHAs to generate temporal\nattentions with consideration of modality and feature importance which leads to\nmore informative embeddings. The proposed modality-aware structure enables the\nmodel to effectively exploit information within each modality as well as foster\ncross-modal understanding. Our extensive experiments on financial datasets\ndemonstrate that Modality-aware Transformer outperforms existing methods,\noffering a novel and practical solution to the complex challenges of\nmulti-modal financial time series forecasting.",

The\nrapid integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), offers opportunities to enhance the equity rating\nprocess. This paper explores the application of LLMs to generate multi-horizon\nstock ratings by ingesting diverse datasets. Traditional stock rating methods\nrely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several\nchallenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed\nreactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs\nto improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings. Additionally, we\nassess the efficacy of using different data modalities with LLMs for the\nfinancial domain.\n  We utilize varied datasets comprising fundamental financial, market, and news\ndata from January 2022 to June 2024, along with GPT-4-32k (v0613) (with a\ntraining cutoff in Sep. 2021 to prevent information leakage). Our results show\nthat our benchmark method outperforms traditional stock rating methods when\nassessed by forward returns, specially when incorporating financial\nfundamentals. While integrating news data improves short-term performance,\nsubstituting detailed news summaries with sentiment scores reduces token use\nwithout loss of performance. In many cases, omitting news data entirely\nenhances performance by reducing bias.\n  Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large\namounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at\nthe stock rating prediction task. Our work provides a reproducible and\nefficient framework for generating accurate stock ratings, serving as a\ncost-effective alternative to traditional methods.

The framework forms a reasoning hierarchy\nwhere LLMs handle intuitive System-1 tasks such as natural language processing,\nwhile the Thinker focuses on cognitive System-2 tasks that require complex\nlogical analysis and domain-specific knowledge. Our framework is presented\nusing a 9-player Werewolf game that demands dual-system reasoning. We introduce\na communication protocol between LLMs and the Thinker, and train the Thinker\nusing data from 18800 human sessions and reinforcement learning. Experiments\ndemonstrate the framework's effectiveness in deductive reasoning, speech\ngeneration, and online game evaluation. Additionally, we fine-tune a 6B LLM to\nsurpass GPT4 when integrated with the Thinker. This paper also contributes the\nlargest dataset for social deduction games to date.",

We focus\non GPT-4o-Mini-2024-08-17 and test two games between LLMs: Rock Paper Scissors\n(RPS) and games of strategy (Prisoners Dilemma PD). LLMs are often described as\nstochastic parrots, and while they may indeed be parrots, our results suggest\nthat they are not very stochastic in the sense that their outputs - when\nprompted to be random - are often very biased. Our research reveals that LLMs\nappear to develop loss aversion strategies in repeated games, with RPS\nconverging to stalemate conditions while PD shows systematic shifts between\ncooperative and competitive outcomes based on prompt design. We detail\nprogrammatic tools for independent agent interactions and the Agentic AI\nchallenges faced in implementation. We show that LLMs can indeed play games,\njust not very well. These results have implications for the use of LLMs in\nmulti-agent LLM systems and showcase limitations in current approaches to model\noutput for strategic decision-making.",

The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs)\noffers an unprecedented opportunity to evolve and empower game agents with\nhuman-like decision-making capabilities in complex computer game environments.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-based game agents from a\nholistic viewpoint. First, we introduce the conceptual architecture of\nLLM-based game agents, centered around three core functional components:\nmemory, reasoning and in/output.

Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of retaining\ninformation long-term and analyzing both visual and textual data, are emerging\nas a potential key to deciphering the complexities of VR's evolving user\ninterfaces. In this paper, we conduct a case study to investigate the\ncapability of using LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, for field of view (FOV) analysis\nin VR exploration testing. Specifically, we validate that LLMs can identify\ntest entities in FOVs and that prompt engineering can effectively enhance the\naccuracy of test entity identification from 41.67% to 71.30%. Our study also\nshows that LLMs can accurately describe identified entities' features with at\nleast a 90% correction rate. We further find out that the core features that\neffectively represent an entity are color, placement, and shape. Furthermore,\nthe combination of the three features can especially be used to improve the\naccuracy of determining identical entities in multiple FOVs with the highest\nF1-score of 0.70. Additionally, our study demonstrates that LLMs are capable of\nscene recognition and spatial understanding in VR with precisely designed\nstructured prompts. Finally, we find that LLMs fail to label the identified\ntest entities, and we discuss potential solutions as future research\ndirections.",

However, unlike traditional web applications,\nHTML5 <canvas> applications render objects onto the <canvas> bitmap without\nrepresenting them in the Document Object Model (DOM). Mismatches between the\nexpected and actual visual output of the <canvas> bitmap are termed visual\nbugs. Due to the visual-centric nature of <canvas> applications, visual bugs\nare important to detect because such bugs can render a <canvas> application\nuseless. As we showed in prior work, Asset-Based graphics can provide the\nground truth for a visual test oracle. However, many <canvas> applications\nprocedurally generate their graphics. In this paper, we investigate how to\ndetect visual bugs in <canvas> applications that use Procedural graphics as\nwell. In particular, we explore the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs)\nto automatically detect visual bugs. Instead of defining an exact visual test\noracle, information about the application's expected functionality (the\ncontext) can be provided with the screenshot as input to the VLM. To evaluate\nthis approach, we constructed a dataset containing 80 bug-injected screenshots\nacross four visual bug types (Layout, Rendering, Appearance, and State) plus 20\nbug-free screenshots from 20 <canvas> applications. We ran experiments with a\nstate-of-the-art VLM using several combinations of text and image context to\ndescribe each application's expected functionality. Our results show that by\nproviding the application README(s), a description of visual bug types, and a\nbug-free screenshot as context, VLMs can be leveraged to detect visual bugs\nwith up to 100% per-application accuracy.",

Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on\nlarge-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However,\nprevious work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting\nenhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a\nnovel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual\nLanguage Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a\nself-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in\nworld knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world\nenvironments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first\nVLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different\natomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a\nsignificant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of\natomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses\ntraditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and\ndatasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in\nhttps://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.",
