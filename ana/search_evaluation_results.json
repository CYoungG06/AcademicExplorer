Therefore, Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly\nfavored for their low inference latency, cost-effectiveness, efficient\ndevelopment, and easy customization and adaptability. These models are\nparticularly well-suited for resource-limited environments and domain knowledge\nacquisition, addressing LLMs' challenges and proving ideal for applications\nthat require localized data handling for privacy, minimal inference latency for\nefficiency, and domain knowledge acquisition through lightweight fine-tuning.\nThe rising demand for SLMs has spurred extensive research and development.\nHowever, a comprehensive survey investigating issues related to the definition,\nacquisition, application, enhancement, and reliability of SLM remains lacking,\nprompting us to conduct a detailed survey on these topics. The definition of\nSLMs varies widely, thus to standardize, we propose defining SLMs by their\ncapability to perform specialized tasks and suitability for\nresource-constrained settings, setting boundaries based on the minimal size for\nemergent abilities and the maximum size sustainable under resource constraints.\nFor other aspects, we provide a taxonomy of relevant models/methods and develop\ngeneral frameworks for each category to enhance and utilize SLMs effectively.",

However, their deployment is\ncostly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized\nalgorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large\npre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social\ncontexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use\nthem for Q&A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on\nin-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human\ninteraction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance\nthereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is\ntherefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations\nprovided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to\nnavigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned\nsmaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the\nsmaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its\nimprovements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the\ntraining examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely\ndifferent game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the\nsmaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the\nbehavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable\nbehavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the\nfine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an\nimprovement of 18% and 28% respectively.",

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant\neffectiveness across a broad range of software tasks, especially in software\ntext generation tasks. Nonetheless, their effectiveness in tasks related to\nSATD is still under-researched. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of\nLLMs in both identification and classification of SATD. For both tasks, we\ninvestigate the performance gain from using more recent LLMs, specifically the\nFlan-T5 family, across different common usage settings. Our results demonstrate\nthat for SATD identification, all fine-tuned LLMs outperform the best existing\nnon-LLM baseline, i.e., the CNN model, with a 4.4% to 7.2% improvement in F1\nscore. In the SATD classification task, while our largest fine-tuned model,\nFlan-T5-XL, still led in performance, the CNN model exhibited competitive\nresults, even surpassing four of six LLMs. We also found that the largest\nFlan-T5 model, i.e., Flan-T5-XXL, when used with a zero-shot in-context\nlearning (ICL) approach for SATD identification, provides competitive results\nwith traditional approaches but performs 6.4% to 9.2% worse than fine-tuned\nLLMs. For SATD classification, few-shot ICL approach, incorporating examples\nand category descriptions in prompts, outperforms the zero-shot approach and\neven surpasses the fine-tuned smaller Flan-T5 models. Moreover, our experiments\ndemonstrate that incorporating contextual information, such as surrounding\ncode, into the SATD classification task enables larger fine-tuned LLMs to\nimprove their performance.",

However, their deployment is\ncostly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized\nalgorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large\npre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social\ncontexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use\nthem for Q&A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on\nin-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human\ninteraction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance\nthereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is\ntherefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations\nprovided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to\nnavigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned\nsmaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the\nsmaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its\nimprovements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the\ntraining examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely\ndifferent game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the\nsmaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the\nbehavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable\nbehavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the\nfine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an\nimprovement of 18% and 28% respectively.",

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant\neffectiveness across a broad range of software tasks, especially in software\ntext generation tasks. Nonetheless, their effectiveness in tasks related to\nSATD is still under-researched. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of\nLLMs in both identification and classification of SATD. For both tasks, we\ninvestigate the performance gain from using more recent LLMs, specifically the\nFlan-T5 family, across different common usage settings. Our results demonstrate\nthat for SATD identification, all fine-tuned LLMs outperform the best existing\nnon-LLM baseline, i.e., the CNN model, with a 4.4% to 7.2% improvement in F1\nscore. In the SATD classification task, while our largest fine-tuned model,\nFlan-T5-XL, still led in performance, the CNN model exhibited competitive\nresults, even surpassing four of six LLMs. We also found that the largest\nFlan-T5 model, i.e., Flan-T5-XXL, when used with a zero-shot in-context\nlearning (ICL) approach for SATD identification, provides competitive results\nwith traditional approaches but performs 6.4% to 9.2% worse than fine-tuned\nLLMs. For SATD classification, few-shot ICL approach, incorporating examples\nand category descriptions in prompts, outperforms the zero-shot approach and\neven surpasses the fine-tuned smaller Flan-T5 models. Moreover, our experiments\ndemonstrate that incorporating contextual information, such as surrounding\ncode, into the SATD classification task enables larger fine-tuned LLMs to\nimprove their performance.",

In what was arguably the first Bayesian case study, Mosteller\nand Wallace (1963) provided the first statistical evidence for attributing all\ndisputed papers to Madison. Our paper revisits this historical dataset but from\na lens of modern language models, both small and large. We review some of the\nmore popular Large Language Model (LLM) tools and examine them from a\nstatistical point of view in the context of text classification. We investigate\nwhether, without any attempt to fine-tune, the general embedding constructs can\nbe useful for stylometry and attribution. We explain differences between\nvarious word/phrase embeddings and discuss how to aggregate them in a document.\nContrary to our expectations, we exemplify that dimension expansion with word\nembeddings may not always be beneficial for attribution relative to dimension\nreduction with topic embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that default LLM\nembeddings (even after manual fine-tuning) may not consistently improve\nauthorship attribution accuracy. Instead, Bayesian analysis with topic\nembeddings trained on ``function words\" yields superior out-of-sample\nclassification performance. This suggests that traditional (small) statistical\nlanguage models, with their interpretability and solid theoretical foundation,\ncan offer significant advantages in authorship attribution tasks.

In this\npaper, we take the first step by examining the pre-training dynamics of the\nemergence of ICL.

Evaluating the ICL ability of LLMs can enhance their utilization and\ndeepen our understanding of how this ability is acquired at the training stage.\nHowever, existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on language abilities\nand knowledge, often overlooking the assessment of ICL ability.

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of\nour datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for\nunderstanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language\nmodels, and practically improving their performance.",

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave revealed remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capability for general zero\nand few-shot learning, recent studies indicate that current LLMs still struggle\nwith zero and few-shot RE. Previous studies are mainly dedicated to design\nprompt formats and select good examples for improving ICL-based RE. Although\nboth factors are vital for ICL, if one can fundamentally boost the ICL\ncapability of LLMs in RE, the zero and few-shot RE performance via ICL would be\nsignificantly improved. To this end, we introduce \\textsc{Micre} (\\textbf{M}eta\n\\textbf{I}n-\\textbf{C}ontext learning of LLMs for \\textbf{R}elation\n\\textbf{E}xtraction), a new meta-training framework for zero and few-shot RE\nwhere an LLM is tuned to do ICL on a diverse collection of RE datasets (i.e.,\nlearning to learn in context for RE). Through meta-training, the model becomes\nmore effectively to learn a new RE task in context by conditioning on a few\ntraining examples with no parameter updates or task-specific templates at\ninference time, enabling better zero and few-shot task generalization. We\nexperiment \\textsc{Micre} on various LLMs with different model scales and 12\npublic RE datasets, and then evaluate it on unseen RE benchmarks under zero and\nfew-shot settings. \\textsc{Micre} delivers comparable or superior performance\ncompared to a range of baselines including supervised fine-tuning and typical\nin-context learning methods. We find that the gains are particular significant\nfor larger model scales, and using a diverse set of the meta-training RE\ndatasets is key to improvements.

Through the\nICLEval benchmark, we demonstrate that ICL ability is universally present in\ndifferent LLMs, and model size is not the sole determinant of ICL efficacy.\nSurprisingly, we observe that ICL abilities, particularly copying, develop\nearly in the pretraining process and stabilize afterward.

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of\nour datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for\nunderstanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language\nmodels, and practically improving their performance.",

Moreover, we observe a\nstrong negative correlation between the competition and ICL performance.\nFurther analysis of common pre-training factors (i.e., model size, dataset\nsize, and data curriculum) demonstrates possible ways to manage the\ncompetition. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method\nto better integrate these two abilities for ICL at inference time. Through\nadaptive ensemble learning, the performance of ICL can be significantly\nboosted, enabling two small models to outperform a larger one with more than\ntwice the parameters.

This work studies this observation theoretically aiming to improve the\nunderstanding of LLM and ICL.

In both settings, we give closed-form optimal\nsolutions and find that smaller models emphasize important hidden features\nwhile larger ones cover more hidden features; thus, smaller models are more\nrobust to noise while larger ones are more easily distracted, leading to\ndifferent ICL behaviors. This sheds light on where transformers pay attention\nto and how that affects ICL. Preliminary experimental results on large base and\nchat models provide positive support for our analysis.",

In this paper, we show that learning on graph data can be\nconceptualized as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process, where\nspecific instances (e.g., nodes or edges) act as queries, and the graph itself\nserves as the retrieved context. Building on this insight, we propose a series\nof RAG frameworks to enhance the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs for\ngraph learning tasks.

We address this limitation by\nadapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive\ntransformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we\nextend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step\ndiffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality\ndistillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's\nODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that\nsupervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach\neffectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing\nlong-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model\nachieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all\nprevious video generation models.

To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is\ncomputationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language\ntokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range\ndependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution\nshort-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an\nunlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer\ntokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a\nmanageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time\nand memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to\nsupport the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on\nlong video sequences.

Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational\nresources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion\ndynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic,\nand temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel\nframework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for\nlong video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range\ntemporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model.\nSpecifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of\nthe DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and\nbalancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive\nnorm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual\nunits from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during\nvideo generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced\nfrom the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent\ntokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on\neight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in\ndynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on\nthe remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process. In\naddition, ARLON achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation.\nDetailed analyses of the improvements in inference efficiency are presented,\nalongside a practical application that demonstrates the generation of long\nvideos using progressive text prompts.

            "abstract": "Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language\ngeneration, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended\ntemporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is\ncomputationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language\ntokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range\ndependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution\nshort-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an\nunlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer\ntokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a\nmanageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time\nand memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to\nsupport the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on\nlong video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet\neffective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.

This\napproach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for\ncontinuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model\nprocesses aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer\nsubsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language\nmodel. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of\nintroducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and\ndeterminism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has\nsuperb scalability.

This success has naturally garnered considerable interest\nfrom both academic and industry researchers. Consequently, numerous Transformer\nvariants (often referred to as X-formers) have been developed for these fields.\nHowever, a thorough and systematic review of these modality-specific\nconversions remains lacking. Modality Conversion involves the transformation of\ndata from one form of representation to another, mimicking the way humans\nintegrate and interpret sensory information. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive review of transformer-based models applied to the primary\nmodalities of text, vision, and speech, discussing their architectures,\nconversion methodologies, and applications. By synthesizing the literature on\nmodality conversion, this survey aims to underline the versatility and\nscalability of transformers in advancing AI-driven content generation and\nunderstanding.",

Humans tends to represent knowledge\nusing two separate systems: one for representing verbal (textual) information\nand one for representing non-verbal (visual and auditory) information. These\ntwo systems can operate independently but can also interact with each other.\nMotivated by this understanding of human cognition, in this paper, we introduce\nCoAVT -- a novel cognition-inspired Correlated Audio-Visual-Text pre-training\nmodel to connect the three modalities. It contains a joint audio-visual encoder\nthat learns to encode audio-visual synchronization information together with\nthe audio and visual content for non-verbal information, and a text encoder to\nhandle textual input for verbal information. To bridge the gap between\nmodalities, CoAVT employs a query encoder, which contains a set of learnable\nquery embeddings, and extracts the most informative audiovisual features of the\ncorresponding text. Additionally, to leverage the correspondences between audio\nand vision with language respectively, we also establish the audio-text and\nvisual-text bi-modal alignments upon the foundational audiovisual-text\ntri-modal alignment to enhance the multimodal representation learning. Finally,\nwe jointly optimize CoAVT model with three multimodal objectives: contrastive\nloss, matching loss and language modeling loss. Extensive experiments show that\nCoAVT can learn strong multimodal correlations and be generalized to various\ndownstream tasks. CoAVT establishes new state-of-the-art performance on\ntext-video retrieval task on AudioCaps for both zero-shot and fine-tuning\nsettings, audio-visual event classification and audio-visual retrieval tasks on\nAudioSet and VGGSound.",

Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable\nlimitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To\naddress this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual\ncapabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks\nsuch as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive\nsurvey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our\nclassification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated\nto vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to\ngenerate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce\nmultimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective\ncapabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various\nmodalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive\nanalysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as\nits strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a\ncomprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the\nperformance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets.

However, existing approaches\npredominantly focus on bimodal interactions, such as image-text pairs, which\nlimits their ability to fully exploit the richness of multi-modal data.\nFurthermore, the integration of modalities in equal-scale environments remains\nunderexplored due to the challenges of constructing large-scale, balanced\ndatasets. In this study, we propose Synergy-CLIP, a novel framework that\nextends the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) architecture to\nenhance multi-modal representation learning by integrating visual, textual, and\naudio modalities. Unlike existing methods that focus on adapting individual\nmodalities to vanilla-CLIP, Synergy-CLIP aligns and captures latent information\nacross three modalities equally. To address the high cost of constructing\nlarge-scale multi-modal datasets, we introduce VGG-sound+, a triple-modal\ndataset designed to provide equal-scale representation of visual, textual, and\naudio data. Synergy-CLIP is validated on various downstream tasks, including\nzero-shot classification, where it outperforms existing baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce a missing modality reconstruction task,\ndemonstrating Synergy-CLIP's ability to extract synergy among modalities in\nrealistic application scenarios.

However, LLM-based agents lack specialization in\ntackling specific target problems, particularly in real-time dynamic\nenvironments. Additionally, deploying an LLM-based agent in practical scenarios\ncan be both costly and time-consuming. On the other hand, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approaches train agents that specialize in the target task but\noften suffer from low sampling efficiency and high exploration costs. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these challenges by\ntraining a smaller, specialized student RL agent using instructions from an\nLLM-based teacher agent. By incorporating the guidance from the teacher agent,\nthe student agent can distill the prior knowledge of the LLM into its own\nmodel. Consequently, the student agent can be trained with significantly less\ndata. Moreover, through further training with environment feedback, the student\nagent surpasses the capabilities of its teacher for completing the target task.\nWe conducted experiments on challenging MiniGrid and Habitat environments,\nspecifically designed for embodied AI research, to evaluate the effectiveness\nof our framework. The results clearly demonstrate that our approach achieves\nsuperior performance compared to strong baseline methods. Our code is available\nat https://github.com/ZJLAB-AMMI/LLM4Teach.",

            "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from sample inefficiency in sparse reward\ndomains, and the problem is further pronounced in case of stochastic\ntransitions. To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied\napproach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to\nan optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

In this paper, we aim to enhance the\ngeneralization capabilities of agents in open-ended text-based learning\nenvironments by integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Large Language\nModels (LLMs). We investigate three types of agents: (i) RL-based agents that\nutilize natural language for state and action representations to find the best\ninteraction strategy, (ii) LLM-based agents that leverage the model's general\nknowledge and reasoning through prompting, and (iii) hybrid LLM-assisted RL\nagents that combine these two strategies to improve agents' performance and\ngeneralization. To support the development and evaluation of these agents, we\nintroduce PharmaSimText, a novel benchmark derived from the PharmaSim virtual\npharmacy environment designed for practicing diagnostic conversations. Our\nresults show that RL-based agents excel in task completion but lack in asking\nquality diagnostic questions. In contrast, LLM-based agents perform better in\nasking diagnostic questions but fall short of completing the task. Finally,\nhybrid LLM-assisted RL agents enable us to overcome these limitations,\nhighlighting the potential of combining RL and LLMs to develop high-performing\nagents for open-ended learning environments.",

In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex\nHumanInformed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4,\na pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language\ntask descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated\nenvironments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance\nfeasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria,\ncreating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable\ntext into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive\nsimulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an\nABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.\nTasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.",

To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied\napproach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to\nan optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

To tackle this issue, this work proposes a teacher-student RL\nframework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as \"teachers\" to guide\nthe agent's learning process by decomposing complex tasks into subgoals. Due to\ntheir inherent capability to understand RL environments based on a textual\ndescription of structure and purpose, LLMs can provide subgoals to accomplish\nthe task defined for the environment in a similar fashion to how a human would\ndo. In doing so, three types of subgoals are proposed: positional targets\nrelative to the agent, object representations, and language-based instructions\ngenerated directly by the LLM. More importantly, we show that it is possible to\nquery the LLM only during the training phase, enabling agents to operate within\nthe environment without any LLM intervention. We assess the performance of this\nproposed framework by evaluating three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs\n(Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen) eliciting subgoals across various procedurally\ngenerated environment of the MiniGrid benchmark. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that this curriculum-based approach accelerates learning and\nenhances exploration in complex tasks, achieving up to 30 to 200 times faster\nconvergence in training steps compared to recent baselines designed for sparse\nreward environments.",

Despite the effectiveness in improving LLM capabilities, its\nimplementation remains highly complex, requiring complex algorithms, reward\nmodeling strategies, and optimization techniques. This complexity poses\nchallenges for researchers and practitioners in developing a systematic\nunderstanding of RL-enhanced LLMs. Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive\nsurvey summarizing existing research on RL-enhanced LLMs has limited progress\nin this domain, hindering further advancements.\n  In this work, we are going to make a systematic review of the most up-to-date\nstate of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze\nthe rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the\ncurrent challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of\nRL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two\nwidely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human\nFeedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4)\nexplore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the\nreward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs\nwith human expectations.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages\nself-feedback as visual cues. Building on this approach, we introduce Volcano,\na multimodal self-feedback guided revision model. Volcano generates natural\nlanguage feedback to its initial response based on the provided visual\ninformation and utilizes this feedback to self-revise its initial response.\nVolcano effectively reduces multimodal hallucination and achieves\nstate-of-the-art on MMHal-Bench, POPE, and GAVIE. It also improves on general\nmultimodal abilities and outperforms previous models on MM-Vet and MMBench.\nThrough qualitative analysis, we show that Volcano's feedback is properly\ngrounded on the image than the initial response. This indicates that Volcano\ncan provide itself with richer visual information through feedback generation,\nleading to self-correct hallucinations.

However, they still suffer\nfrom hallucination problems referring to generating inconsistent outputs with\nthe image content. To mitigate hallucinations, previous studies mainly focus on\nretraining LVLMs with custom datasets. Although effective, they inherently come\nwith additional computational costs. In this paper, we propose a training-free\nframework, \\textbf{MVP}, that aims to reduce hallucinations by making the most\nof the innate capabilities of the LVLMs via \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew\nMulti-\\textbf{P}ath Reasoning. Specifically, we first devise a multi-view\ninformation-seeking strategy to thoroughly perceive the comprehensive\ninformation in the image, which enriches the general global information\ncaptured by the original vision encoder in LVLMs. Furthermore, during the\nanswer decoding, we observe that the occurrence of hallucinations has a strong\ncorrelation with the certainty of the answer tokens. Thus, we propose\nmulti-path reasoning for each information view to quantify and aggregate the\ncertainty scores for each potential answer among multiple decoding paths and\nfinally decide the output answer. By fully grasping the information in the\nimage and carefully considering the certainty of the potential answers when\ndecoding, our MVP can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs.The extensive\nexperiments verify that our proposed MVP significantly mitigates the\nhallucination problem across four well-known LVLMs. The source code is\navailable at: \\url{https://github.com/GasolSun36/MVP}.",

Moreover, when transferred to\naugmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even\nexacerbated.Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we\nintroduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large\nvision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by\nincorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets\nbased on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the\nmost effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval\nresults. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low\ncertainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high\ncertainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing\nhallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and\nmPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks. Our empirical observations suggest that by\nutilizing fitting retrieval mechanisms and timing the retrieval judiciously, we\ncan effectively mitigate the hallucination problem.

Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a\ntaxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data\nconstruction pipeline based on it. Leveraging advanced large multimodal models\nand human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs. Finally,\nwe introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency\nby organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs.\nEvaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and\nSDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art\nbaselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all\ncomponents. A win rate of over 50% in human reviews also proves that\nInstructEngine better aligns with human preferences.",

The various inconsistencies and defects\nobserved in such videos are inherently complex, making overall scoring\nnotoriously difficult. In this paper, we emphasize the critical importance of\nintegrating fine-grained reasoning into video evaluation, and we propose\n$\\textbf{F}$ing$\\textbf{ER}$, a novel entity-level reasoning evaluation\nframework that first automatically generates $\\textbf{F}$ine-grained\n$\\textbf{E}$ntity-level questions, and then answers those questions by a\n$\\textbf{R}$easoning model with scores, which can be subsequently weighted\nsummed to an overall score for different applications. Specifically, we\nleverage LLMs to derive entity-level questions across five distinct\nperspectives, which (i) often focus on some specific entities of the content,\nthereby making answering or scoring much easier by MLLMs, and (ii) are more\ninterpretable. Then we construct a FingER dataset, consisting of approximately\n3.3k videos and corresponding 60k fine-grained QA annotations, each with\ndetailed reasons. Based on that, we further investigate various training\nprotocols to best incentivize the reasoning capability of MLLMs for correct\nanswer prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a reasoning model\ntrained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a cold-start\nstrategy achieves the best performance. Notably, our model surpasses existing\nmethods by a relative margin of $11.8\\%$ on GenAI-Bench and $5.5\\%$ on\nMonetBench with only 3.3k training videos, which is at most one-tenth of the\ntraining samples utilized by other methods.

In\nthis paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language\nmodel (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with\npaired audio) captioning through directed preference optimization (DPO). We\npropose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video\ndescriptions, which are optimized using DPO. To further improve training, we\nintroduce a novel multi-round DPO (mrDPO) approach, which involves periodically\nupdating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initializing the LoRA module\nas a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and\nincorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilize the\nprocess. To address potential catastrophic forgetting of non-captioning\nabilities due to mrDPO, we propose rebirth tuning, which finetunes the pre-DPO\nLLM by using the captions generated by the mrDPO-trained model as supervised\nlabels. Experiments show that mrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's\ncaptioning accuracy, reducing global and local error rates by 40\\% and 20\\%,\nrespectively, while decreasing the repetition rate by 35\\%. The final\nvideo-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters, surpasses leading models\nsuch as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning tasks, while maintaining\ncompetitive performance to the state-of-the-art on widely used video\nquestion-answering benchmark among models of similar size. Upon acceptance, we\nwill release the code, model checkpoints, and training and test data. Demos are\navailable at\n\\href{https://video-salmonn-2.github.io}{https://video-salmonn-2.github.io}.",

However, maintaining LLM safety\nthroughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as\nresolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial.\nTypically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related\ncategories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of\nsafety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather\nthan a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive\nsafety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe\nresponses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness.\nTo understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by\ncategorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group\nbehaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between\nsafety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a\nFine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment\neven with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA)\napproach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient\nmasking strategy.

To explore the factors that impact evaluation reliability, we\nfine-tune an underperforming VLM judge, Video-LLaVA, and observe that improved\nunderstanding ability alone is insufficient to make VLM judges more reliable.\nThese findings stress the limitations of collective thought approaches and\nhighlight the need for more advanced methods that can account for the\nreliability of individual models.

In this study, we propose\nSafe RLHF-V, the first multimodal safety alignment framework that jointly\noptimizes helpfulness and safety using separate multimodal reward and cost\nmodels within a Lagrangian-based constrained optimization framework. Given that\nthere is a lack of preference datasets that separate helpfulness and safety in\nmultimodal scenarios, we introduce BeaverTails-V, the first open-source dataset\nwith dual preference annotations for helpfulness and safety, along with\nmulti-level safety labels (minor, moderate, severe).

By applying the Beaver-Guard-V moderation for 5 rounds of\nfiltering and re-generation on the precursor model, the overall safety of the\nupstream model is significantly improved by an average of 40.9%.

These hallucinations present\nchallenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy.\nExisting hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external\nresources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete\ncoverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor\nscalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which\nare often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper\npresents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that\nleverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods,\nMetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both\nopen-source and closed-source LLMs. MetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if\nan LLM's response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will\nbe violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource\nhallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on\ntwo open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA\noutperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score.

However, current\napproaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt\nengineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within\ncontrolled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that\nfail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we\nintroduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end\ntraining of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement\nlearning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search\ninteractions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information\nexists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy,\nunstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized\nmulti-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information\nfrom various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical\nchallenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate\nthat DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over\nprompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL\nagents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from\nend-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans,\ncross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to\nredirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers.\nOur results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments\nis not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for\ndeveloping robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.\nWe release DeepResearcher at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DeepResearcher.",

These hallucinations present\nchallenges for LLM-based applications that demand high factual accuracy.\nExisting hallucination detection methods primarily depend on external\nresources, which can suffer from issues such as low availability, incomplete\ncoverage, privacy concerns, high latency, low reliability, and poor\nscalability. There are also methods depending on output probabilities, which\nare often inaccessible for closed-source LLMs like GPT models. This paper\npresents MetaQA, a self-contained hallucination detection approach that\nleverages metamorphic relation and prompt mutation. Unlike existing methods,\nMetaQA operates without any external resources and is compatible with both\nopen-source and closed-source LLMs. MetaQA is based on the hypothesis that if\nan LLM's response is a hallucination, the designed metamorphic relations will\nbe violated. We compare MetaQA with the state-of-the-art zero-resource\nhallucination detection method, SelfCheckGPT, across multiple datasets, and on\ntwo open-source and two closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that MetaQA\noutperforms SelfCheckGPT in terms of precision, recall, and f1 score. For the\nfour LLMs we study, MetaQA outperforms SelfCheckGPT with a superiority margin\nranging from 0.041 - 0.113 (for precision), 0.143 - 0.430 (for recall), and\n0.154 - 0.368 (for F1-score). For instance, with Mistral-7B, MetaQA achieves an\naverage F1-score of 0.435, compared to SelfCheckGPT's F1-score of 0.205,\nrepresenting an improvement rate of 112.2%. MetaQA also demonstrates\nsuperiority across all different categories of questions.",

This paper surveys current research to\nprovide an in-depth overview of LLM-based intelligent agents within\nsingle-agent and multi-agent systems. It covers their definitions, research\nframeworks, and foundational components such as their composition, cognitive\nand planning methods, tool utilization, and responses to environmental\nfeedback. We also delve into the mechanisms of deploying LLM-based agents in\nmulti-agent systems, including multi-role collaboration, message passing, and\nstrategies to alleviate communication issues between agents. The discussions\nalso shed light on popular datasets and application scenarios. We conclude by\nenvisioning prospects for LLM-based agents, considering the evolving landscape\nof AI and natural language processing.",

However, current\nbenchmarks are often simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well and\nmaking it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks\ntypically rely on static question-answer pairs that the models might memorize\nor guess. To address these limitations, we introduce Dynamic Intelligence\nAssessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic\nquestion templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as\nmathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The\naccompanying dataset, DIA-Bench, contains a diverse collection of challenge\ntemplates with mutable parameters presented in various formats, including text,\nPDFs, compiled binaries, visual puzzles, and CTF-style cybersecurity\nchallenges. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's\nreliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed\nthat even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in\nvarying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably,\nAPI models like GPT-4o often overestimated their mathematical capabilities,\nwhile ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better performance due to effective tool usage.\nIn self-assessment, OpenAI's o1-mini proved to have the best judgement on what\ntasks it should attempt to solve. We evaluated 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using\nDIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often\ndisplay unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions.

We employ GPT-4 for\nautomated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over\nearlier LLM-based evaluations. Utilizing MMBench-Video, we have conducted\ncomprehensive evaluations that include both proprietary and open-source LVLMs\nfor images and videos. MMBench-Video stands as a valuable resource for the\nresearch community, facilitating improved evaluation of LVLMs and catalyzing\nprogress in the field of video understanding.

Most existing video\nunderstanding models work well on short videos of pre-segmented events, yet\nthey struggle to summarise longer videos where relevant events are sparsely\ndistributed and not pre-segmented. Moreover, long-form video understanding\noften relies on supervised hierarchical training that needs extensive\nannotations which are costly, slow and prone to inconsistency. With ViSMaP we\nbridge the gap between short videos (where annotated data is plentiful) and\nlong ones (where it's not). We rely on LLMs to create optimised\npseudo-summaries of long videos using segment descriptions from short ones.\nThese pseudo-summaries are used as training data for a model that generates\nlong-form video summaries, bypassing the need for expensive annotations of long\nvideos. Specifically, we adopt a meta-prompting strategy to iteratively\ngenerate and refine creating pseudo-summaries of long videos. The strategy\nleverages short clip descriptions obtained from a supervised short video model\nto guide the summary. Each iteration uses three LLMs working in sequence: one\nto generate the pseudo-summary from clip descriptions, another to evaluate it,\nand a third to optimise the prompt of the generator. This iteration is\nnecessary because the quality of the pseudo-summaries is highly dependent on\nthe generator prompt, and varies widely among videos. We evaluate our summaries\nextensively on multiple datasets; our results show that ViSMaP achieves\nperformance comparable to fully supervised state-of-the-art models while\ngeneralising across domains without sacrificing performance.

However, as the length\nof the video increases, generating long, detailed captions becomes a\nsignificant challenge. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of LMMs in\ngenerating long captions for long videos. Our analysis reveals that open-source\nLMMs struggle to consistently produce outputs exceeding 300 words, leading to\nincomplete or overly concise descriptions of the visual content.

Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality\nto merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual\nqueries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex\nquestion-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex\nprompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an\nadaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an\nauto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various\nvideo understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering,\nand video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage.\nNotably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU\ndataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.",

Our analysis suggests three key\ndesign principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid\ninitial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best\nformulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we\npropose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent\npreferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for\nreinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and\nLlama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF.\nExperimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward\nshaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at\nleast 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR\nexhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward\nfor optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even\nafter two full epochs of training.

Given a goal described in\nnatural language, Text2Reward generates shaped dense reward functions as an\nexecutable program grounded in a compact representation of the environment.\nUnlike inverse RL and recent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes\nor unshaped dense rewards with a constant function across timesteps,\nText2Reward produces interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a\nwide range of tasks, utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement\nwith human feedback. We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation\nbenchmarks (ManiSkill2, MetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo.\nOn 13 of the 17 manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward\ncodes achieve similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than\nexpert-written reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel\nlocomotion behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show\nthat the policies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in\nthe real world.

To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied\napproach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to\nan optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

Recently, an additional post-ranking\nstage is suggested in SE to enhance user satisfaction in practical\napplications. Nevertheless, research dedicated to enhancing the post-ranking\nstage through LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce a\nnovel paradigm named Large Language Models for Post-Ranking in search engine\n(LLM4PR), which leverages the capabilities of LLMs to accomplish the\npost-ranking task in SE. Concretely, a Query-Instructed Adapter (QIA) module is\ndesigned to derive the user/item representation vectors by incorporating their\nheterogeneous features. A feature adaptation step is further introduced to\nalign the semantics of user/item representations with the LLM. Finally, the\nLLM4PR integrates a learning to post-rank step, leveraging both a main task and\nan auxiliary task to fine-tune the model to adapt the post-ranking task.\nExperiment studies demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to significant\nimprovements and exhibits state-of-the-art performance compared with other\nalternatives.",

This paper explores the zero-shot abilities\nof recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of\nliterature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two\ncomponents: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing\na literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective\nLLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step\nsearch strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the\nabstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying\nan external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking\nmechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized\nrecall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the\nLLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step\napproach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in\nthe plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based\nliterature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a\nprotocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set\ncontamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to\npromote additional research and development in this regard.

            "abstract": "Scaling up neural networks has led to remarkable performance across a wide\nrange of tasks. Moreover, performance often follows reliable scaling laws as a\nfunction of training set size, model size, and compute, which offers valuable\nguidance as large-scale experiments are becoming increasingly expensive.\nHowever, previous work on scaling laws has primarily used private data \\&\nmodels or focused on uni-modal language or vision learning. To address these\nlimitations, we investigate scaling laws for contrastive language-image\npre-training (CLIP) with the public LAION dataset and the open-source OpenCLIP\nrepository. Our large-scale experiments involve models trained on up to two\nbillion image-text pairs and identify power law scaling for multiple downstream\ntasks including zero-shot classification, retrieval, linear probing, and\nend-to-end fine-tuning. We find that the training distribution plays a key role\nin scaling laws as the OpenAI and OpenCLIP models exhibit different scaling\nbehavior despite identical model architectures and similar training recipes. We\nopen-source our evaluation workflow and all models, including the largest\npublic CLIP models, to ensure reproducibility and make scaling laws research\nmore accessible.

Instead of scaling up video foundation models\nthrough expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling\n(TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation\nmodel is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much\ncan it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this\nwork, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching\nproblem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target\nvideo distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time\nverifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching\nprocess. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search\nstrategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step\ndenoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs,\nwe further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called\nTree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an\nautoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video\ngeneration benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute\nconsistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.\nProject page: https://liuff19.github.io/Video-T1",

We present the first work towards understanding\nthis new system design space for multi-modal text-to-image (TTI) and\ntext-to-video (TTV) generation models. Current model architecture designs are\nbifurcated into 2 categories: Diffusion- and Transformer-based models. Our\nsystematic performance characterization on a suite of eight representative\nTTI/TTV models shows that after state-of-the-art optimization techniques such\nas Flash Attention are applied, Convolution accounts for up to 44% of execution\ntime for Diffusion-based TTI models, while Linear layers consume up to 49% of\nexecution time for Transformer-based models. We additionally observe that\nDiffusion-based TTI models resemble the Prefill stage of LLM inference, and\nbenefit from 1.1-2.5x greater speedup from Flash Attention than\nTransformer-based TTI models that resemble the Decode phase. Since\noptimizations designed for LLMs do not map directly onto TTI/TTV models, we\nmust conduct a thorough characterization of these workloads to gain insights\nfor new optimization opportunities. In doing so, we define sequence length in\nthe context of TTI/TTV models and observe sequence length can vary up to 4x in\nDiffusion model inference. We additionally observe temporal aspects of TTV\nworkloads pose unique system bottlenecks, with Temporal Attention accounting\nfor over 60% of total Attention time. Overall, our in-depth system performance\ncharacterization is a critical first step towards designing efficient and\ndeployable systems for emerging TTI/TTV workloads.",

Current surveys on\nimage-text multimodal models mainly focus on representative models or\napplication domains, but lack a review on how general technical models\ninfluence the development of domain-specific models, which is crucial for\ndomain researchers. Based on this, this paper first reviews the technological\nevolution of image-text multimodal models, from early explorations of feature\nspace to visual language encoding structures, and then to the latest large\nmodel architectures. Next, from the perspective of technological evolution, we\nexplain how the development of general image-text multimodal technologies\npromotes the progress of multimodal technologies in the biomedical field, as\nwell as the importance and complexity of specific datasets in the biomedical\ndomain. Then, centered on the tasks of image-text multimodal models, we analyze\ntheir common components and challenges. After that, we summarize the\narchitecture, components, and data of general image-text multimodal models, and\nintroduce the applications and improvements of image-text multimodal models in\nthe biomedical field. Finally, we categorize the challenges faced in the\ndevelopment and application of general models into external factors and\nintrinsic factors, further refining them into 2 external factors and 5\nintrinsic factors, and propose targeted solutions, providing guidance for\nfuture research directions.

However, existing models still struggle\nwith long video processing due to the context length constraint of LLMs and the\nvast amount of information within the video. Although some recent methods are\ndesigned for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information\nduring token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio. In\nthis work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the\ntemporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC).\nFirstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on\ninter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio\nencoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce\nthe number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based\nTransformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a\nlimited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame\ntokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding.\nFurthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free\nchain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple\nvideo segments. These intermediate answers serve as part of the reasoning\nprocess and contribute to the final answer. We conduct extensive experiments on\ngeneral video understanding and audio-video understanding benchmarks, where our\nmethod demonstrates strong performance.

Although the Mixture of Experts\n(MoE) architecture has been employed to efficiently scale large language and\nimage-text models, these efforts typically involve fewer experts and limited\nmodalities. To address this, our work presents the pioneering attempt to\ndevelop a unified MLLM with the MoE architecture, named Uni-MoE that can handle\na wide array of modalities. Specifically, it features modality-specific\nencoders with connectors for a unified multimodal representation. We also\nimplement a sparse MoE architecture within the LLMs to enable efficient\ntraining and inference through modality-level data parallelism and expert-level\nmodel parallelism. To enhance the multi-expert collaboration and\ngeneralization, we present a progressive training strategy: 1) Cross-modality\nalignment using various connectors with different cross-modality data, 2)\nTraining modality-specific experts with cross-modality instruction data to\nactivate experts' preferences, and 3) Tuning the Uni-MoE framework utilizing\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on mixed multimodal instruction data. We evaluate\nthe instruction-tuned Uni-MoE on a comprehensive set of multimodal datasets.\nThe extensive experimental results demonstrate Uni-MoE's principal advantage of\nsignificantly reducing performance bias in handling mixed multimodal datasets,\nalongside improved multi-expert collaboration and generalization.

To improve the quality of\ngenerated videos, we determine the best practices of Latte through rigorous\nexperimental analysis, including video clip patch embedding, model variants,\ntimestep-class information injection, temporal positional embedding, and\nlearning strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Latte\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across four standard video generation\ndatasets, i.e., FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, UCF101, and Taichi-HD. In\naddition, we extend Latte to the text-to-video generation (T2V) task, where\nLatte achieves results that are competitive with recent T2V models.

To mitigate the excessive influence of\nreference image features and textual guidance on generated video content during\ninference, we implement the Time-Aware Reference Attention Bias (TAB) strategy,\ndynamically modulating reference bias over different time steps.

In this work, we analyze camera motion from a\nfirst principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera\nmanipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that\nmotion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This\nmotivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating\ntraining convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by\nprobing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we\nobserve that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and\nonly a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This\nsuggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the\narchitecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x\nreduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher\nvisual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control\nlearning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary\ncameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and\nimproves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these\nfindings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture, the new\nstate-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.",

The transformer\nhas been used as a replacement for the widely used convolution operators, due\nto its ability to learn long-range dependencies. This replacement was proven to\nbe successful in numerous tasks, in which several state-of-the-art methods rely\non transformers for better learning. In computer vision, the 3D field has also\nwitnessed an increase in employing the transformer for 3D convolution neural\nnetworks and multi-layer perceptron networks. Although a number of surveys have\nfocused on transformers in vision in general, 3D vision requires special\nattention due to the difference in data representation and processing when\ncompared to 2D vision. In this work, we present a systematic and thorough\nreview of more than 100 transformers methods for different 3D vision tasks,\nincluding classification, segmentation, detection, completion, pose estimation,\nand others. We discuss transformer design in 3D vision, which allows it to\nprocess data with various 3D representations.

World models, which simulate the\ndynamics of real-world environments, and video generation models, which produce\nrealistic video sequences, are increasingly being integrated to improve\nsituational awareness and decision-making capabilities in autonomous vehicles.\nThis paper investigates the relationship between these two technologies,\nfocusing on how their structural parallels, particularly in diffusion-based\nmodels, contribute to more accurate and coherent simulations of driving\nscenarios. We examine leading works such as JEPA, Genie, and Sora, which\nexemplify different approaches to world model design, thereby highlighting the\nlack of a universally accepted definition of world models. These diverse\ninterpretations underscore the field's evolving understanding of how world\nmodels can be optimized for various autonomous driving tasks. Furthermore, this\npaper discusses the key evaluation metrics employed in this domain, such as\nChamfer distance for 3D scene reconstruction and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance\n(FID) for assessing the quality of generated video content. By analyzing the\ninterplay between video generation and world models, this survey identifies\ncritical challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the potential\nof these technologies to jointly advance the performance of autonomous driving\nsystems.

            "abstract": "The motion transfer task involves transferring motion from a source video to\nnewly generated videos, requiring the model to decouple motion from appearance.\nPrevious diffusion-based methods primarily rely on separate spatial and\ntemporal attention mechanisms within 3D U-Net. In contrast, state-of-the-art\nvideo Diffusion Transformers (DiT) models use 3D full attention, which does not\nexplicitly separate temporal and spatial information. Thus, the interaction\nbetween spatial and temporal dimensions makes decoupling motion and appearance\nmore challenging for DiT models. In this paper, we propose DeT, a method that\nadapts DiT models to improve motion transfer ability. Our approach introduces a\nsimple yet effective temporal kernel to smooth DiT features along the temporal\ndimension, facilitating the decoupling of foreground motion from background\nappearance. Meanwhile, the temporal kernel effectively captures temporal\nvariations in DiT features, which are closely related to motion. Moreover, we\nintroduce explicit supervision along dense trajectories in the latent feature\nspace to further enhance motion consistency. Additionally, we present MTBench,\na general and challenging benchmark for motion transfer. We also introduce a\nhybrid motion fidelity metric that considers both the global and local motion\nsimilarity. Therefore, our work provides a more comprehensive evaluation than\nprevious works. Extensive experiments on MTBench demonstrate that DeT achieves\nthe best trade-off between motion fidelity and edit fidelity.",

The transformer\nhas been used as a replacement for the widely used convolution operators, due\nto its ability to learn long-range dependencies. This replacement was proven to\nbe successful in numerous tasks, in which several state-of-the-art methods rely\non transformers for better learning. In computer vision, the 3D field has also\nwitnessed an increase in employing the transformer for 3D convolution neural\nnetworks and multi-layer perceptron networks. Although a number of surveys have\nfocused on transformers in vision in general, 3D vision requires special\nattention due to the difference in data representation and processing when\ncompared to 2D vision. In this work, we present a systematic and thorough\nreview of more than 100 transformers methods for different 3D vision tasks,\nincluding classification, segmentation, detection, completion, pose estimation,\nand others. We discuss transformer design in 3D vision, which allows it to\nprocess data with various 3D representations. For each application, we\nhighlight key properties and contributions of proposed transformer-based\nmethods. To assess the competitiveness of these methods, we compare their\nperformance to common non-transformer methods on 12 3D benchmarks. We conclude\nthe survey by discussing different open directions and challenges for\ntransformers in 3D vision.

To\naddress these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's\nself-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we\nfirst show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline\nmodel-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling\nself-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT falls\nprey to either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the\ndata-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to behavior collapse,\nwhere learning implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior\nthat is often not effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe\naddresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of\nself-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer\nthe learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective\nat test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt.\nThis regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a\nbase model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to\ncollapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With\nGemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves\nstate-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models'\nself-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on MATH and HumanEval.",

Specifically, we\ncollect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial\nand refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs\nduring the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs\nstruggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without\nadditional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their\nperformance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when\ntheir self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and\ndisfavored samples.

            "abstract": "Self-correction is a highly desirable capability of large language models\n(LLMs), yet it has consistently been found to be largely ineffective in modern\nLLMs. Current methods for training self-correction typically depend on either\nmultiple models, a more advanced model, or additional forms of supervision. To\naddress these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's\nself-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we\nfirst show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline\nmodel-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling\nself-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT falls\nprey to either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the\ndata-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to behavior collapse,\nwhere learning implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior\nthat is often not effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe\naddresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of\nself-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer\nthe learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective\nat test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt.\nThis regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a\nbase model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to\ncollapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With\nGemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves\nstate-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models'\nself-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on MATH and HumanEval.",

With the goal of improving the performance\nof ICL, we propose corrective in-context learning (CICL), an approach that\nincorporates a model's incorrect predictions alongside ground truth corrections\ninto the prompt, aiming to enhance classification accuracy through\nself-correction. However, contrary to our hypothesis, extensive experiments on\ntext classification tasks demonstrate that CICL consistently underperforms\nstandard ICL, with performance degrading as the proportion of corrections in\nthe prompt increases. Our findings indicate that CICL introduces confusion by\ndisrupting the model's task understanding, rather than refining its\npredictions. Additionally, we observe that presenting harder examples in\nstandard ICL does not improve performance, suggesting that example difficulty\nalone may not be a reliable criterion for effective selection.

Drawing upon insights from psychological and neural science,\nthis work presents a practical definition of self-consciousness for language\nmodels and refines ten core concepts. Our work pioneers an investigation into\nself-consciousness in language models by, for the first time, leveraging causal\nstructural games to establish the functional definitions of the ten core\nconcepts. Based on our definitions, we conduct a comprehensive four-stage\nexperiment: quantification (evaluation of ten leading models), representation\n(visualization of self-consciousness within the models), manipulation\n(modification of the models' representation), and acquisition (fine-tuning the\nmodels on core concepts). Our findings indicate that although models are in the\nearly stages of developing self-consciousness, there is a discernible\nrepresentation of certain concepts within their internal mechanisms. However,\nthese representations of self-consciousness are hard to manipulate positively\nat the current stage, yet they can be acquired through targeted fine-tuning.\nOur datasets and code are at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/SelfConsciousness.",

Internal\nconsistency refers to the consistency in expressions among LLMs' latent,\ndecoding, or response layers based on sampling methodologies. Then, we\nintroduce an effective theoretical framework capable of mining internal\nconsistency, named Self-Feedback. This framework consists of two modules:\nSelf-Evaluation and Self-Update.

Despite their promising capabilities, when required\nto produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities\nunbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear\nvulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature\nReview (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential\ndrawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular,\nfirst we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by\nLLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs\nto detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting\nstrategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we\nprovide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact\nperformance in the aforementioned tasks.",

By innovatively introducing online\nreference retrieval, a pre-processing method called AttributeTree, and a\nre-polishing process, SurveyX significantly enhances the efficacy of survey\ncomposition. Experimental evaluation results show that SurveyX outperforms\nexisting automated survey generation systems in content quality (0.259\nimprovement) and citation quality (1.76 enhancement), approaching human expert\nperformance across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Integrating large language models into\nagent-based modeling and simulation presents a promising avenue for enhancing\nsimulation capabilities. This paper surveys the landscape of utilizing large\nlanguage models in agent-based modeling and simulation, examining their\nchallenges and promising future directions. In this survey, since this is an\ninterdisciplinary field, we first introduce the background of agent-based\nmodeling and simulation and large language model-empowered agents. We then\ndiscuss the motivation for applying large language models to agent-based\nsimulation and systematically analyze the challenges in environment perception,\nhuman alignment, action generation, and evaluation. Most importantly, we\nprovide a comprehensive overview of the recent works of large language\nmodel-empowered agent-based modeling and simulation in multiple scenarios,\nwhich can be divided into four domains: cyber, physical, social, and hybrid,\ncovering simulation of both real-world and virtual environments. Finally, since\nthis area is new and quickly evolving, we discuss the open problems and\npromising future directions.",

Previous research in this field often focuses on\ntraining agents with limited knowledge within isolated environments, which\ndiverges significantly from human learning processes, and thus makes the agents\nhard to achieve human-like decisions. Recently, through the acquisition of vast\namounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nremarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence. This has sparked an\nupsurge in studies investigating LLM-based autonomous agents. In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive survey of these studies, delivering a systematic review\nof the field of LLM-based autonomous agents from a holistic perspective. More\nspecifically, we first discuss the construction of LLM-based autonomous agents,\nfor which we propose a unified framework that encompasses a majority of the\nprevious work.

As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase\nof ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper.

In this survey\npaper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin\nwith a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review\nwhat ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the\nincorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods,\nnew datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for\nASPR.

However, fine-tuning reinforcement learning (RL) models\nremains a challenge. This work conceptualizes one specific cause of poor\ntransfer, accentuated in the RL setting by the interplay between actions and\nobservations: forgetting of pre-trained capabilities. Namely, a model\ndeteriorates on the state subspace of the downstream task not visited in the\ninitial phase of fine-tuning, on which the model behaved well due to\npre-training. This way, we lose the anticipated transfer benefits. We identify\nconditions when this problem occurs, showing that it is common and, in many\ncases, catastrophic. Through a detailed empirical analysis of the challenging\nNetHack and Montezuma's Revenge environments, we show that standard knowledge\nretention techniques mitigate the problem and thus allow us to take full\nadvantage of the pre-trained capabilities. In particular, in NetHack, we\nachieve a new state-of-the-art for neural models, improving the previous best\nscore from $5$K to over $10$K points in the Human Monk scenario.",

While\nthese paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often\ninvolve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning.\nTo systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new\nmultimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a\nsix-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite\nand verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual\nreasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same\ndata source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing\nSFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn\nreasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid\nreasoning modes that impede further learning.

A large number of work has been conducted to\nimprove the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either\nmodifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still\nlack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what\nkind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon\nthe SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand\nthe correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually\ncraft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a\nsynthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic\nfunctions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train\nand test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through\ncomprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions\nare indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic\nfunctions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target\ndomain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3)\nTraining RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the\nSFT phase.",

Instead, our\napproach uses cross attention signals within the model itself to derive a self\nsupervised reward, thereby guiding iterative fine tuning of the model policy.\nBy analyzing how the model attends to the input prompt during generation, we\nconstruct measures of prompt coverage, focus, and coherence. We then use these\nmeasures to rank or score candidate responses, providing a reward signal that\nencourages the model to produce well aligned, on topic text. In empirical\ncomparisons against standard policy gradient methods and RL fine tuning with\nsynthetic preference models, our method shows significant gains in prompt\nrelevance and consistency over a non RL baseline. While it does not yet match\nthe performance of fully human supervised RLHF systems, it highlights an\nimportant direction for scaling alignment with minimal human labeling. We\nprovide a detailed analysis, discuss potential limitations, and outline future\nwork for combining cross-attention based signals with smaller amounts of human\nfeedback.",

However, training LLMs to serve as effective assistants for\nhumans requires careful consideration. A promising approach is reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), which leverages human feedback to update\nthe model in accordance with human preferences and mitigate issues like\ntoxicity and hallucinations. Yet, an understanding of RLHF for LLMs is largely\nentangled with initial design choices that popularized the method and current\nresearch focuses on augmenting those choices rather than fundamentally\nimproving the framework. In this paper, we analyze RLHF through the lens of\nreinforcement learning principles to develop an understanding of its\nfundamentals, dedicating substantial focus to the core component of RLHF -- the\nreward model. Our study investigates modeling choices, caveats of function\napproximation, and their implications on RLHF training algorithms, highlighting\nthe underlying assumptions made about the expressivity of reward. Our analysis\nimproves the understanding of the role of reward models and methods for their\ntraining, concurrently revealing limitations of the current methodology. We\ncharacterize these limitations, including incorrect generalization, model\nmisspecification, and the sparsity of feedback, along with their impact on the\nperformance of a language model. The discussion and analysis are substantiated\nby a categorical review of current literature, serving as a reference for\nresearchers and practitioners to understand the challenges of RLHF and build\nupon existing efforts.",

We will also point out current challenges and\ndeficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further\nimprovements.

However, current\nbias mitigation methods often require intensive human feedback, lack\ntransferability to other topics or yield overconfident and random outputs. We\nfind that involving LLMs in role-playing scenario boosts their ability to\nrecognize and mitigate biases. Based on this, we propose Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Multi-role Debates as Feedback (RLDF), a novel approach for bias\nmitigation replacing human feedback in traditional RLHF. We utilize LLMs in\nmulti-role debates to create a dataset that includes both high-bias and\nlow-bias instances for training the reward model in reinforcement learning. Our\napproach comprises two modes: (1) self-reflection, where the same LLM\nparticipates in multi-role debates, and (2) teacher-student, where a more\nadvanced LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo guides the LLM to perform this task.\nExperimental results across different LLMs on BBQ and our datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach in bias mitigation.

Instead, our\napproach uses cross attention signals within the model itself to derive a self\nsupervised reward, thereby guiding iterative fine tuning of the model policy.\nBy analyzing how the model attends to the input prompt during generation, we\nconstruct measures of prompt coverage, focus, and coherence. We then use these\nmeasures to rank or score candidate responses, providing a reward signal that\nencourages the model to produce well aligned, on topic text. In empirical\ncomparisons against standard policy gradient methods and RL fine tuning with\nsynthetic preference models, our method shows significant gains in prompt\nrelevance and consistency over a non RL baseline. While it does not yet match\nthe performance of fully human supervised RLHF systems, it highlights an\nimportant direction for scaling alignment with minimal human labeling.

To address these concerns, alignment\ntechniques have been developed to improve the public usability and safety of\nLLMs. Yet, the potential for generating harmful content through these models\nseems to persist. This paper explores the concept of jailbreaking\nLLMs-reversing their alignment through adversarial triggers. Previous methods,\nsuch as soft embedding prompts, manually crafted prompts, and gradient-based\nautomatic prompts, have had limited success on black-box models due to their\nrequirements for model access and for producing a low variety of manually\ncrafted prompts, making them susceptible to being blocked. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize\nadversarial triggers, requiring only inference API access to the target model\nand a small surrogate model. Our method, which leverages a BERTScore-based\nreward function, enhances the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial\ntriggers on new black-box models.

First, implicit arguments are\nevent arguments which are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but can be\ninferred through context. Second, scattered arguments are event arguments that\nare composed of information scattered throughout the text. These two argument\ntypes are crucial to elicit the full breadth of information required for proper\nevent modeling.\n  To support the extraction of explicit, implicit, and scattered arguments, we\ndevelop a novel dataset, DiscourseEE, which includes 7,464 argument annotations\nfrom online health discourse. Notably, 51.2% of the arguments are implicit, and\n17.4% are scattered, making DiscourseEE a unique corpus for complex event\nextraction. Additionally, we formulate argument extraction as a text generation\nproblem to facilitate the extraction of complex argument types.

In this study, we consider a more realistic setting of this task,\nnamely the Oracle-Free Event Extraction (OFEE) task, where only the input\ncontext is given without any oracle information, including event type, event\nontology and trigger word. To solve this task, we propose a new framework,\ncalled COFFEE, which extracts the events solely based on the document context\nwithout referring to any oracle information. In particular, a contrastive\nselection model is introduced in COFFEE to rectify the generated triggers and\nhandle multi-event instances. The proposed COFFEE outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches under the oracle-free setting of the event extraction task, as\nevaluated on a public event extraction benchmark ACE05.",

For the first challenge, we propose a collaborative\nannotation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Through collaboration\namong multiple LLMs, it first refines annotations of trigger words from distant\nsupervision and then carries out argument annotation. Next, a voting phase\nconsolidates the annotation preferences across different LLMs. Finally, we\ncreate the EEMT dataset, the largest EE dataset to date, featuring over 200,000\nsamples, 3,465 event types, and 6,297 role types. For the second challenge, we\npropose an LLM-based Partitioning EE method called LLM-PEE. To overcome the\nlimited context length of LLMs, LLM-PEE first recalls candidate event types and\nthen splits them into multiple partitions for LLMs to extract events. The\nresults in the supervised setting show that LLM-PEE outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by 5.4 in event detection and 6.1 in argument\nextraction.

Event arguments are\nthen extracted with respect to the trigger. Indeed, triggers are treated as\nintegral to, and trigger detection as an essential component of, event\nextraction. In this paper, we provide the first investigation of the role of\ntriggers for the more difficult and much less studied task of document-level\nevent extraction. We analyze their usefulness in multiple end-to-end and\npipelined neural event extraction models for three document-level event\nextraction datasets, measuring performance using triggers of varying quality\n(human-annotated, LLM-generated, keyword-based, and random). Our research shows\nthat trigger effectiveness varies based on the extraction task's\ncharacteristics and data quality, with basic, automatically-generated triggers\nserving as a viable alternative to human-annotated ones. Furthermore, providing\ndetailed event descriptions to the extraction model helps maintain robust\nperformance even when trigger quality degrades. Perhaps surprisingly, we also\nfind that the mere existence of trigger input, even random ones, is important\nfor prompt-based LLM approaches to the task.",

In this study, we revisit this\ndefinition of Event Extraction (EE) by introducing two key argument types that\ncannot be modeled by existing EE frameworks. First, implicit arguments are\nevent arguments which are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but can be\ninferred through context. Second, scattered arguments are event arguments that\nare composed of information scattered throughout the text. These two argument\ntypes are crucial to elicit the full breadth of information required for proper\nevent modeling.\n  To support the extraction of explicit, implicit, and scattered arguments, we\ndevelop a novel dataset, DiscourseEE, which includes 7,464 argument annotations\nfrom online health discourse. Notably, 51.2% of the arguments are implicit, and\n17.4% are scattered, making DiscourseEE a unique corpus for complex event\nextraction. Additionally, we formulate argument extraction as a text generation\nproblem to facilitate the extraction of complex argument types. We provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and highlight critical open\nchallenges in generative event extraction.

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave revealed remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capability for general zero\nand few-shot learning, recent studies indicate that current LLMs still struggle\nwith zero and few-shot RE. Previous studies are mainly dedicated to design\nprompt formats and select good examples for improving ICL-based RE. Although\nboth factors are vital for ICL, if one can fundamentally boost the ICL\ncapability of LLMs in RE, the zero and few-shot RE performance via ICL would be\nsignificantly improved. To this end, we introduce \\textsc{Micre} (\\textbf{M}eta\n\\textbf{I}n-\\textbf{C}ontext learning of LLMs for \\textbf{R}elation\n\\textbf{E}xtraction), a new meta-training framework for zero and few-shot RE\nwhere an LLM is tuned to do ICL on a diverse collection of RE datasets (i.e.,\nlearning to learn in context for RE). Through meta-training, the model becomes\nmore effectively to learn a new RE task in context by conditioning on a few\ntraining examples with no parameter updates or task-specific templates at\ninference time, enabling better zero and few-shot task generalization. We\nexperiment \\textsc{Micre} on various LLMs with different model scales and 12\npublic RE datasets, and then evaluate it on unseen RE benchmarks under zero and\nfew-shot settings. \\textsc{Micre} delivers comparable or superior performance\ncompared to a range of baselines including supervised fine-tuning and typical\nin-context learning methods. We find that the gains are particular significant\nfor larger model scales, and using a diverse set of the meta-training RE\ndatasets is key to improvements.

One\ncrucial step before the application of such LLMs in these fields is to\nunderstand and compare the performance in different use cases in such tasks.\nThis paper explored the efficacy of LLMs in the e-commerce domain, focusing on\ninstruction-tuning an open source LLM model with public e-commerce datasets of\nvarying sizes and comparing the performance with the conventional models\nprevalent in industrial applications. We conducted a comprehensive comparison\nbetween LLMs and traditional pre-trained language models across specific tasks\nintrinsic to the e-commerce domain, namely classification, generation,\nsummarization, and named entity recognition (NER). Furthermore, we examined the\neffectiveness of the current niche industrial application of very large LLM,\nusing in-context learning, in e-commerce specific tasks. Our findings indicate\nthat few-shot inference with very large LLMs often does not outperform\nfine-tuning smaller pre-trained models, underscoring the importance of\ntask-specific model optimization.Additionally, we investigated different\ntraining methodologies such as single-task training, mixed-task training, and\nLoRA merging both within domain/tasks and between different tasks. Through\nrigorous experimentation and analysis, this paper offers valuable insights into\nthe potential effectiveness of LLMs to advance natural language processing\ncapabilities within the e-commerce industry.",

Our proposed\nmodules include (1) a one-input-multiple-prompts strategy that employs multiple\nprompts for one input to accommodate more demonstrations; (2) using fine-tuned\nmodels for better demonstration retrieval; (3) transforming tasks to formats\nthat are more tailored to the generation nature; (4) employing reasoning\nstrategies that are tailored to addressing the task-specific complexity; (5)\nthe self-verification strategy to address the hallucination issue of LLMs; (6)\nthe paraphrase strategy to improve the robustness of model predictions.\n  We conduct experiments on 21 datasets of 10 representative NLP tasks,\nincluding question answering, commonsense reasoning, natural language\ninference, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, entity-relation\nextraction, event extraction, dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, and\npart-of-speech tagging.

However,\nfully fine-tuning these models remains expensive, requiring extensive\ncomputational resources, memory, and task-specific data. Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a promising solution that allows adapting\nlarge models to downstream tasks by updating only a small portion of\nparameters. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of PEFT techniques,\nfocusing on their motivations, design principles, and effectiveness. We begin\nby analyzing the resource and accessibility challenges posed by traditional\nfine-tuning and highlight key issues, such as overfitting, catastrophic\nforgetting, and parameter inefficiency. We then introduce a structured taxonomy\nof PEFT methods -- grouped into additive, selective, reparameterized, hybrid,\nand unified frameworks -- and systematically compare their mechanisms and\ntrade-offs. Beyond taxonomy, we explore the impact of PEFT across diverse\ndomains, including language, vision, and generative modeling, showing how these\ntechniques offer strong performance with lower resource costs. We also discuss\nimportant open challenges in scalability, interpretability, and robustness, and\nsuggest future directions such as federated learning, domain adaptation, and\ntheoretical grounding. Our goal is to provide a unified understanding of PEFT\nand its growing role in enabling practical, efficient, and sustainable use of\nlarge models.",

On the other hand, while finetuning LLMs on\ntask-specific data generally improves their performance, abundant annotated\ndatasets are not available for all tasks. Previous work has explored generating\ntask-specific data from state-of-the-art LLMs and using this data to finetune\nsmaller models, but this approach requires access to a language model other\nthan the one being trained, which introduces cost, scalability challenges, and\nlegal hurdles associated with continuously relying on more powerful LLMs. In\nresponse to these, we propose SELF-GUIDE, a multi-stage mechanism in which we\nsynthesize task-specific input-output pairs from the student LLM, then use\nthese input-output pairs to finetune the student LLM itself. In our empirical\nevaluation of the Natural Instructions V2 benchmark, we find that SELF-GUIDE\nimproves the performance of LLM by a substantial margin. Specifically, we\nreport an absolute improvement of approximately 15% for classification tasks\nand 18% for generation tasks in the benchmark's metrics.

With strong language processing\ncapabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have\nbecome popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far,\nLLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which\nrestricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given\nthese restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal\nfor LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals\nrelevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full\npotential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose\nin-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in\nattention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient\nre-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration\nmethod using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only\nrequires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it\nsubstantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at\nleast $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to\nany LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking.\nExtensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop\nand multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms\nRankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through\ndetailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks\nthat require more complex re-ranking signals. Our findings call for further\nexploration on novel ways of utilizing open-weight LLMs beyond text generation.",

In\nthis paper, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting a comprehensive study on\nsupervised fine-tuning of LLMs using instruction-tuning datasets spanning\ndiverse knowledge domains and skills. We focus on small-sized LLMs (3B to 7B\nparameters) for their cost-efficiency and accessibility. We explore various\ntraining configurations and strategies across four open-source pre-trained\nmodels. We provide detailed documentation of these configurations, revealing\nfindings that challenge several common training practices, including\nhyperparameter recommendations from TULU and phased training recommended by\nOrca. Key insights from our work include: (i) larger batch sizes paired with\nlower learning rates lead to improved model performance on benchmarks such as\nMMLU, MTBench, and Open LLM Leaderboard; (ii) early-stage training dynamics,\nsuch as lower gradient norms and higher loss values, are strong indicators of\nbetter final model performance, enabling early termination of sub-optimal runs\nand significant computational savings; (iii) through a thorough exploration of\nhyperparameters like warmup steps and learning rate schedules, we provide\nguidance for practitioners and find that certain simplifications do not\ncompromise performance; and (iv) we observed no significant difference in\nperformance between phased and stacked training strategies, but stacked\ntraining is simpler and more sample efficient.

Existing studies report on their capability to support\nvarious data-driven process analyses and even, to some extent, that they are\nable to reason about how processes work. This reasoning ability suggests that\nthere is potential for LLMs to tackle semantics-aware process mining tasks,\nwhich are tasks that rely on an understanding of the meaning of activities and\ntheir relationships. Examples of these include process discovery, where the\nmeaning of activities can indicate their dependency, whereas in anomaly\ndetection the meaning can be used to recognize process behavior that is\nabnormal. In this paper, we systematically explore the capabilities of LLMs for\nsuch tasks. Unlike prior work, which largely evaluates LLMs in their default\nstate, we investigate their utility through both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define five process mining tasks\nrequiring semantic understanding and provide extensive benchmarking datasets\nfor evaluation. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with\nchallenging process mining tasks when used out of the box or with minimal\nin-context examples, they achieve strong performance when fine-tuned for these\ntasks across a broad range of process types and industries.",

In this study, we equip LLMs with prompts, rather than\nrelying on an external paraphraser, to evaluate the vulnerability of these\ndetectors. We propose a novel Substitution-based In-Context example\nOptimization method (SICO) to automatically construct prompts for evading the\ndetectors.

Extensive experiments across three real-world tasks\ndemonstrate that SICO significantly outperforms the paraphraser baselines and\nenables GPT-3.5 to successfully evade six detectors, decreasing their AUC by\n0.5 on average. Furthermore, a comprehensive human evaluation show that the\nSICO-generated text achieves human-level readability and task completion rates,\nwhile preserving high imperceptibility.

The proposed approach utilizes a\nmulti-model setup, incorporating a Prompting language model to generate\nwatermarking instructions, a Marking language model to embed watermarks within\ngenerated content, and a Detecting language model to verify the presence of\nthese watermarks. Experiments are conducted using ChatGPT and Mistral as the\nPrompting and Marking language models, with detection accuracy evaluated using\na pretrained classifier model. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework\nachieves high classification accuracy across various configurations, with 95%\naccuracy for ChatGPT, 88.79% for Mistral. These findings validate the and\nadaptability of the proposed watermarking strategy across different language\nmodel architectures. Hence the proposed framework holds promise for\napplications in content attribution, copyright protection, and model\nauthentication.",

However, the misuse of LLMs raises concerns about\nthe authenticity and ethical implications of the content they produce, such as\ndeepfake news, academic fraud, and copyright infringement. Watermarking\ntechniques, which embed identifiable markers in machine-generated text, offer a\npromising solution to these issues by allowing for content verification and\norigin tracing. Unfortunately, the robustness of current LLM watermarking\nschemes under potential watermark removal attacks has not been comprehensively\nexplored.\n  In this paper, to fill this gap, we first systematically comb the mainstream\nwatermarking schemes and removal attacks on machine-generated texts, and then\nwe categorize them into pre-text (before text generation) and post-text (after\ntext generation) classes so that we can conduct diversified analyses. In our\nexperiments, we evaluate eight watermarks (five pre-text, three post-text) and\ntwelve attacks (two pre-text, ten post-text) across 87 scenarios. Evaluation\nresults indicate that (1) KGW and Exponential watermarks offer high text\nquality and watermark retention but remain vulnerable to most attacks; (2)\nPost-text attacks are found to be more efficient and practical than pre-text\nattacks; (3) Pre-text watermarks are generally more imperceptible, as they do\nnot alter text fluency, unlike post-text watermarks; (4) Additionally, combined\nattack methods can significantly increase effectiveness, highlighting the need\nfor more robust watermarking solutions.

Next, we investigate watermarking methods designed for the content\ngenerated by LLMs, assessing their effectiveness and resilience against various\nattacks. We also highlight the importance of watermarking domain-specific\nmodels and data, such as those used in code generation, chip design, and\nmedical applications. Furthermore, we explore methods like hardware\nacceleration to improve the efficiency of the watermarking process. Finally, we\ndiscuss the limitations of current approaches and outline future research\ndirections for the responsible use and protection of these generative AI tools.",

These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering,\nand recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its\norigins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models.\nWhile the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and\nsemantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face\nchallenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of\ncontextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution\nrequires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse\nretrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as\nlanguage models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the\nemergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has\nrevolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language\nunderstanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities.\nConsequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR\nsystems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary\nto consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a\ncomprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs\nand IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers,\nrerankers, and readers.

            "abstract": "Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions\ngoverned by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop\ncapable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major\napproach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding\nand generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language\nmodels to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)\nhave been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora,\nshowing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers\nhave found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further\nstudy the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size.\nInterestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged\nlanguage models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also\nshow some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language\nmodels. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research\ncommunity has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of\nsignificant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by\nboth academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT,\nwhich has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution\nof LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which\nwould revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this\nsurvey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background,\nkey findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major\naspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and\ncapacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for\ndeveloping LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.",

We contribute to this\nresearch line by systematically investigating the effects of chain-of-thought\nreasoning, in-context learning (ICL), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on\nsyllogistic reasoning, considering syllogisms with conclusions that support or\nviolate world knowledge, as well as ones with multiple premises.

For humans to be able to trust LLM-based applications, their\noutputs should be consistent when prompted with inputs that carry the same\nmeaning or intent. Despite this need, there is no known mechanism to control\nand guide LLMs to be more consistent at inference time. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel alignment strategy to maximize semantic consistency in LLM\noutputs. Our proposal is based on Chain of Guidance (CoG), a multistep\nprompting technique that generates highly consistent outputs from LLMs. For\nclosed-book question-answering (Q&A) tasks, when compared to direct prompting,\nthe outputs generated using CoG show improved consistency. While other\napproaches like template-based responses and majority voting may offer\nalternative paths to consistency, our work focuses on exploring the potential\nof guided prompting. We use synthetic data sets comprised of consistent\ninput-output pairs to fine-tune LLMs to produce consistent and correct outputs.\nOur fine-tuned models are more than twice as consistent compared to base models\nand show strong generalization capabilities by producing consistent outputs\nover datasets not used in the fine-tuning process.",

Nevertheless, their robustness\nis still far from optimal, as they may generate significantly inconsistent\nresponses due to minor changes in the verbalized instructions. Recent\nliterature has explored this inconsistency issue, highlighting the importance\nof continued improvement in the robustness of response generation. However,\nsystematic analysis and solutions are still lacking. In this paper, we\nquantitatively define the inconsistency problem and propose a two-stage\ntraining framework consisting of instruction-augmented supervised fine-tuning\nand consistency alignment training. The first stage helps a model generalize on\nfollowing instructions via similar instruction augmentations. In the second\nstage, we improve the diversity and help the model understand which responses\nare more aligned with human expectations by differentiating subtle differences\nin similar responses. The training process is accomplished by self-rewards\ninferred from the trained model at the first stage without referring to\nexternal human preference resources. We conduct extensive experiments on recent\npublicly available LLMs on instruction-following tasks and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our training framework.",

While\nthese paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often\ninvolve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning.\nTo systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new\nmultimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a\nsix-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite\nand verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual\nreasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same\ndata source.

            "abstract": "In the field of large language models (LLMs), aligning models with the\ndiverse preferences of users is a critical challenge. Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) has played a key role in this area. It works by using pairs\nof preferences derived from the same prompts, and it functions without needing\nan additional reward model. However, DPO does not fully reflect the complex\nnature of human learning, which often involves understanding contrasting\nresponses to not only identical but also similar questions. To overcome this\nshortfall, we propose Relative Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO is designed\nto discern between more and less preferred responses derived from both\nidentical and related prompts. It introduces a contrastive weighting mechanism,\nenabling the tuning of LLMs using a broader range of preference data, including\nboth paired and unpaired sets. This approach expands the learning capabilities\nof the model, allowing it to leverage insights from a more varied set of\nprompts. Through empirical tests, including dialogue and summarization tasks,\nand evaluations using the AlpacaEval2.0 leaderboard, RPO has demonstrated a\nsuperior ability to align LLMs with user preferences and to improve their\nadaptability during the training process.

However, these designs mainly\nfocus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the\nselection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g.,\naccessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To\novercome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to\nefficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint.\nTRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization\nand fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB);\nthus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically\nand also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the\nremarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying\nthe limited budget constraints.

            "abstract": "Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for\ncontemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages:\n1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from\nhuman demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used\nto learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL)\nstep to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human\npreference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model\nquality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from\nlearning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data\ndirectly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to simultaneously build an reward model\nand a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only\nefficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality\nsupervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the\nproposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play\nFine-tune (SPIN). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge\nto the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B\nmodels using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and\nthe HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant\nperformance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that\nit is beneficial to leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment\nprocess.",

However, prompt-based tools like ChatGPT\nhave made AES more accessible, enabling educators to obtain machine-generated\nscores using natural-language prompts (i.e., the prompt-based paradigm).\nDespite advancements, prior studies have shown bias in fine-tuned LLMs,\nparticularly against disadvantaged groups.

Using a publicly available dataset of over 25,000 students'\nargumentative essays, we designed prompts to elicit demographic inferences\n(i.e., gender, first-language background) from GPT-4o and assessed fairness in\nautomated scoring. Then we conducted multivariate regression analysis to\nexplore the impact of the model's ability to predict demographics on its\nscoring outcomes. Our findings revealed that (i) prompt-based LLMs can somewhat\ninfer students' demographics, particularly their first-language backgrounds,\nfrom their essays; (ii) scoring biases are more pronounced when the LLM\ncorrectly predicts students' first-language background than when it does not;\nand (iii) scoring error for non-native English speakers increases when the LLM\ncorrectly identifies them as non-native.",

Current AI systems, including those designed for\ncomplex tasks like autonomous driving, problem-solving challenges such as the\nAbstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), and conversational benchmarks like the\nTuring Test, often lack the ability to adapt to new situations without\nextensive prior knowledge. This manuscript argues that integrating common sense\ninto AI systems is essential for achieving true autonomy and unlocking the full\nsocietal and commercial value of AI.\n  We propose a shift in the order of knowledge acquisition emphasizing the\nimportance of developing AI systems that start from minimal prior knowledge and\nare capable of contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment -- even\nwithin abstract domains. Additionally, we highlight the need to rethink the AI\nsoftware stack to address this foundational challenge. Without common sense, AI\nsystems may never reach true autonomy, instead exhibiting asymptotic\nperformance that approaches theoretical ideals like AIXI but remains\nunattainable in practice due to infinite resource and computation requirements.\n  While scaling AI models and passing benchmarks like the Turing Test have\nbrought significant advancements in applications that do not require autonomy,\nthese approaches alone are insufficient to achieve autonomous AI with common\nsense. By redefining existing benchmarks and challenges to enforce constraints\nthat require genuine common sense, and by broadening our understanding of\nembodiment to include both physical and abstract domains, we can encourage the\ndevelopment of AI systems better equipped to handle the complexities of\nreal-world and abstract environments.",

            "abstract": "The development of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, has enabled the\nconstruction of several socialbots, like ChatGPT, that are receiving a lot of\nattention for their ability to simulate a human conversation. However, the\nconversation is not guided by a goal and is hard to control. In addition,\nbecause LLMs rely more on pattern recognition than deductive reasoning, they\ncan give confusing answers and have difficulty integrating multiple topics into\na cohesive response. These limitations often lead the LLM to deviate from the\nmain topic to keep the conversation interesting. We propose AutoCompanion, a\nsocialbot that uses an LLM model to translate natural language into predicates\n(and vice versa) and employs commonsense reasoning based on Answer Set\nProgramming (ASP) to hold a social conversation with a human. In particular, we\nrely on s(CASP), a goal-directed implementation of ASP as the backend. This\npaper presents the framework design and how an LLM is used to parse user\nmessages and generate a response from the s(CASP) engine output. To validate\nour proposal, we describe (real) conversations in which the chatbot's goal is\nto keep the user entertained by talking about movies and books, and s(CASP)\nensures (i) correctness of answers, (ii) coherence (and precision) during the\nconversation, which it dynamically regulates to achieve its specific purpose,\nand (iii) no deviation from the main topic.",

In addition, we also create two new\ndatasets, X-CSQA and X-CODAH, by translating their English versions to 15 other\nlanguages, so that we can evaluate popular ML-LMs for cross-lingual commonsense\nreasoning. To improve the performance beyond English, we propose a simple yet\neffective method -- multilingual contrastive pre-training (MCP).

Proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy\noptimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive\nto hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE,\non the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high\nmemory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal\nperformance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of\nthe REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and\nusing a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To\naddress these challenges, we systematically analyze the\nefficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose\nleave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP\ncombines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling\nmultiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the\nrobustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling.\nOur results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on\nvarious black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between\ncomputational efficiency and performance.",

Proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy\noptimization.

While the variance of\nthe REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and\nusing a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To\naddress these challenges, we systematically analyze the\nefficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose\nleave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP\ncombines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling\nmultiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the\nrobustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling.\nOur results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on\nvarious black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between\ncomputational efficiency and performance.",

Specifically, IPO exploits a\ncritic model to justify video generations for pairwise ranking as in Direct\nPreference Optimization or point-wise scoring as in Kahneman-Tversky\nOptimization. Given this, IPO optimizes video foundation models with guidance\nof signals from preference feedback, which helps improve generated video\nquality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc.\nIn addition, IPO incorporates the critic model with the multi-modality large\nlanguage model, which enables it to automatically assign preference labels\nwithout need of retraining or relabeling. In this way, IPO can efficiently\nperform multi-round preference optimization in an iterative manner, without the\nneed of tediously manual labeling.

In\nthis paper, we propose Dynamic World Simulation (DWS), a novel approach to\ntransform pre-trained video generative models into controllable world\nsimulators capable of executing specified action trajectories. To achieve\nprecise alignment between conditioned actions and generated visual changes, we\nintroduce a lightweight, universal action-conditioned module that seamlessly\nintegrates into any existing model. Instead of focusing on complex visual\ndetails, we demonstrate that consistent dynamic transition modeling is the key\nto building powerful world simulators. Building upon this insight, we further\nintroduce a motion-reinforced loss that enhances action controllability by\ncompelling the model to capture dynamic changes more effectively. Experiments\ndemonstrate that DWS can be versatilely applied to both diffusion and\nautoregressive transformer models, achieving significant improvements in\ngenerating action-controllable, dynamically consistent videos across games and\nrobotics domains.

Empirically, DDPO is able to adapt text-to-image\ndiffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting,\nsuch as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as\naesthetic quality.

In this paper, we address the challenge of building one model that can\nfulfil multiple latency levels and we achieve this by introducing lightweight\nadapter modules into the decoder. The adapters are trained to be specialized\nfor different wait-$k$ values and compared to other techniques they offer more\nflexibility to allow for reaping the benefits of parameter sharing and\nminimizing interference. Additionally, we show that by combining with an\nadaptive strategy, we can further improve the results. Experiments on two\nlanguage directions show that our method outperforms or competes with other\nstrong baselines on most latency values.",

            "abstract": "The explosive growth of videos on streaming media platforms has underscored\nthe urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to\nmonitor and perceptually optimize the quality of streaming videos. However, VQA\nremains an extremely challenging task due to the diverse video content and the\ncomplex spatial and temporal distortions, thus necessitating more advanced\nmethods to address these issues. Nowadays, large multimodal models (LMMs), such\nas GPT-4V, have exhibited strong capabilities for various visual understanding\ntasks, motivating us to leverage the powerful multimodal representation ability\nof LMMs to solve the VQA task. Therefore, we propose the first Large\nMulti-Modal Video Quality Assessment (LMM-VQA) model, which introduces a novel\nspatiotemporal visual modeling strategy for quality-aware feature extraction.\nSpecifically, we first reformulate the quality regression problem into a\nquestion and answering (Q&A) task and construct Q&A prompts for VQA instruction\ntuning. Then, we design a spatiotemporal vision encoder to extract spatial and\ntemporal features to represent the quality characteristics of videos, which are\nsubsequently mapped into the language space by the spatiotemporal projector for\nmodality alignment. Finally, the aligned visual tokens and the quality-inquired\ntext tokens are aggregated as inputs for the large language model (LLM) to\ngenerate the quality score and level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLMM-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks,\nexhibiting an average improvement of $5\\%$ in generalization ability over\nexisting methods. Furthermore, due to the advanced design of the spatiotemporal\nencoder and projector, LMM-VQA also performs exceptionally well on general\nvideo understanding tasks, further validating its effectiveness. Our code will\nbe released at https://github.com/Sueqk/LMM-VQA.",

The\nlack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this\ndilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception\ncapabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a\ncomprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT)\ndataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics\nfoundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics\nperception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904\ndiverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are\ncollected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic\ngrades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle\ndiverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and\nassemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT,\nwhich consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic\ncapabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced\ngeneral foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models,\ndubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert\nmodels deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and\nGemini-Pro-Vision.

However, VQA\nremains an extremely challenging task due to the diverse video content and the\ncomplex spatial and temporal distortions, thus necessitating more advanced\nmethods to address these issues. Nowadays, large multimodal models (LMMs), such\nas GPT-4V, have exhibited strong capabilities for various visual understanding\ntasks, motivating us to leverage the powerful multimodal representation ability\nof LMMs to solve the VQA task. Therefore, we propose the first Large\nMulti-Modal Video Quality Assessment (LMM-VQA) model, which introduces a novel\nspatiotemporal visual modeling strategy for quality-aware feature extraction.\nSpecifically, we first reformulate the quality regression problem into a\nquestion and answering (Q&A) task and construct Q&A prompts for VQA instruction\ntuning. Then, we design a spatiotemporal vision encoder to extract spatial and\ntemporal features to represent the quality characteristics of videos, which are\nsubsequently mapped into the language space by the spatiotemporal projector for\nmodality alignment. Finally, the aligned visual tokens and the quality-inquired\ntext tokens are aggregated as inputs for the large language model (LLM) to\ngenerate the quality score and level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLMM-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks,\nexhibiting an average improvement of $5\\%$ in generalization ability over\nexisting methods. Furthermore, due to the advanced design of the spatiotemporal\nencoder and projector, LMM-VQA also performs exceptionally well on general\nvideo understanding tasks, further validating its effectiveness.

To address this task, we propose VCoME, a general framework\nthat employs a large multimodal model to generate editing effects for video\ncomposition.

VCoME also supports\nprompt-based control of composition density and style, providing substantial\nflexibility for diverse applications.

Different from other\nschemes which solely utilize the decoded RGB frames, MM-ViT operates\nexclusively in the compressed video domain and exploits all readily available\nmodalities, i.e., I-frames, motion vectors, residuals and audio waveform. In\norder to handle the large number of spatiotemporal tokens extracted from\nmultiple modalities, we develop several scalable model variants which factorize\nself-attention across the space, time and modality dimensions. In addition, to\nfurther explore the rich inter-modal interactions and their effects, we develop\nand compare three distinct cross-modal attention mechanisms that can be\nseamlessly integrated into the transformer building block. Extensive\nexperiments on three public action recognition benchmarks (UCF-101,\nSomething-Something-v2, Kinetics-600) demonstrate that MM-ViT outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art video transformers in both efficiency and accuracy, and\nperforms better or equally well to the state-of-the-art CNN counterparts with\ncomputationally-heavy optical flow.",

Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other\ntasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These\napproaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to\nscale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive\nevaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of\nusing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for\nAIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding\ncapabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV\nevaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects\nvideos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human\npreference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we\nextensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while\nadvanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human\nevaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation,\nsignificantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally,\nwe conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the\nperformance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future\nresearch on AIGV evaluation.

The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from\nvision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both\nimage and video understanding benchmarks.",

Recently, multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) have shown great potential in image quality assessment (IQA) and\nimage aesthetic assessment (IAA). Despite this progress, effectively scoring\nthe quality and aesthetics of UGC images still faces two main challenges: 1) A\nsingle score is inadequate to capture the hierarchical human perception. 2) How\nto use MLLMs to output numerical scores, such as mean opinion scores (MOS),\nremains an open question. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\ndataset, named Realistic image Quality and Aesthetic (RealQA), including 14,715\nUGC images, each of which is annoted with 10 fine-grained attributes. These\nattributes span three levels: low level (e.g., image clarity), middle level\n(e.g., subject integrity) and high level (e.g., composition). Besides, we\nconduct a series of in-depth and comprehensive investigations into how to\neffectively predict numerical scores using MLLMs. Surprisingly, by predicting\njust two extra significant digits, the next token paradigm can achieve SOTA\nperformance. Furthermore, with the help of chain of thought (CoT) combined with\nthe learnt fine-grained attributes, the proposed method can outperform SOTA\nmethods on five public datasets for IQA and IAA with superior interpretability\nand show strong zero-shot generalization for video quality assessment (VQA).\nThe code and dataset will be released.",

            "abstract": "The rapid expansion of mobile internet has resulted in a substantial increase\nin user-generated content (UGC) images, thereby making the thorough assessment\nof UGC images both urgent and essential. Recently, multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) have shown great potential in image quality assessment (IQA) and\nimage aesthetic assessment (IAA). Despite this progress, effectively scoring\nthe quality and aesthetics of UGC images still faces two main challenges: 1) A\nsingle score is inadequate to capture the hierarchical human perception. 2) How\nto use MLLMs to output numerical scores, such as mean opinion scores (MOS),\nremains an open question. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\ndataset, named Realistic image Quality and Aesthetic (RealQA), including 14,715\nUGC images, each of which is annoted with 10 fine-grained attributes. These\nattributes span three levels: low level (e.g., image clarity), middle level\n(e.g., subject integrity) and high level (e.g., composition). Besides, we\nconduct a series of in-depth and comprehensive investigations into how to\neffectively predict numerical scores using MLLMs. Surprisingly, by predicting\njust two extra significant digits, the next token paradigm can achieve SOTA\nperformance. Furthermore, with the help of chain of thought (CoT) combined with\nthe learnt fine-grained attributes, the proposed method can outperform SOTA\nmethods on five public datasets for IQA and IAA with superior interpretability\nand show strong zero-shot generalization for video quality assessment (VQA).\nThe code and dataset will be released.",

            "abstract": "The explosive growth of videos on streaming media platforms has underscored\nthe urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to\nmonitor and perceptually optimize the quality of streaming videos. However, VQA\nremains an extremely challenging task due to the diverse video content and the\ncomplex spatial and temporal distortions, thus necessitating more advanced\nmethods to address these issues. Nowadays, large multimodal models (LMMs), such\nas GPT-4V, have exhibited strong capabilities for various visual understanding\ntasks, motivating us to leverage the powerful multimodal representation ability\nof LMMs to solve the VQA task. Therefore, we propose the first Large\nMulti-Modal Video Quality Assessment (LMM-VQA) model, which introduces a novel\nspatiotemporal visual modeling strategy for quality-aware feature extraction.\nSpecifically, we first reformulate the quality regression problem into a\nquestion and answering (Q&A) task and construct Q&A prompts for VQA instruction\ntuning. Then, we design a spatiotemporal vision encoder to extract spatial and\ntemporal features to represent the quality characteristics of videos, which are\nsubsequently mapped into the language space by the spatiotemporal projector for\nmodality alignment. Finally, the aligned visual tokens and the quality-inquired\ntext tokens are aggregated as inputs for the large language model (LLM) to\ngenerate the quality score and level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLMM-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks,\nexhibiting an average improvement of $5\\%$ in generalization ability over\nexisting methods. Furthermore, due to the advanced design of the spatiotemporal\nencoder and projector, LMM-VQA also performs exceptionally well on general\nvideo understanding tasks, further validating its effectiveness. Our code will\nbe released at https://github.com/Sueqk/LMM-VQA.",

The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from\nvision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both\nimage and video understanding benchmarks.",

To address these issues, we\npresent two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely\nLing-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as \"Bailing\" in Chinese, spelled\nB\\v{a}il\\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75\nbillion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters\nwith 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable\nperformance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable\ninsights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in\nresource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable\ntechnologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE\nmodels, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model\narchitecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly\nhandling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally,\nleveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models\ndemonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models.\nUltimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be\neffectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable\nperformance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models.\nCompared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware\nsystem during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings,\nreducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

To address these issues, we\npresent two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely\nLing-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as \"Bailing\" in Chinese, spelled\nB\\v{a}il\\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75\nbillion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters\nwith 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable\nperformance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable\ninsights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in\nresource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable\ntechnologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE\nmodels, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model\narchitecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly\nhandling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally,\nleveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models\ndemonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models.\nUltimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be\neffectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable\nperformance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models.\nCompared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware\nsystem during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings,\nreducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

However, scaling law only\ngives a qualitative estimation of loss, which is influenced by various factors\nsuch as model architectures, data distributions, tokenizers, and computation\nprecision. Thus, estimating the real performance of LLMs with different\ntraining settings rather than loss may be quite useful in practical\ndevelopment. In this article, we present an empirical equation named\n\"Performance Law\" to directly predict the MMLU score of an LLM, which is a\nwidely used metric to indicate the general capability of LLMs in real-world\nconversations and applications. Based on only a few key hyperparameters of the\nLLM architecture and the size of training data, we obtain a quite accurate MMLU\nprediction of various LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures developed by\ndifferent organizations in different years. Performance law can be used to\nguide the choice of LLM architecture and the effective allocation of\ncomputational resources without extensive experiments.",

In this paper, we investigate how the pre-training loss,\nsupervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the reasoning\nperformances of a supervised LLM. We find that pre-training loss is a better\nindicator of the model's performance than the model's parameter count. We apply\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with different amounts of supervised data and\nempirically find a log-linear relation between data amount and model\nperformance, and we find better models improve less with enlarged supervised\ndatasets. To augment more data samples for improving model performances without\nany human effort, we propose to apply Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). RFT\nuses supervised models to generate and collect correct reasoning paths as\naugmented fine-tuning datasets. We find with augmented samples containing more\ndistinct reasoning paths, RFT improves mathematical reasoning performance more\nfor LLMs. We also find RFT brings more improvement for less performant LLMs.\nFurthermore, we combine rejection samples from multiple models which push\nLLaMA-7B to an accuracy of 49.3\\% on GSM8K which outperforms the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) accuracy of 35.9\\% significantly.",

At a high level, Q-probing sits\nbetween heavier approaches such as finetuning and lighter approaches such as\nfew shot prompting, but can also be combined with either. The idea is to learn\na simple linear function on a model's embedding space that can be used to\nreweight candidate completions. We theoretically show that this sampling\nprocedure is equivalent to a KL-constrained maximization of the Q-probe as the\nnumber of samples increases. To train the Q-probes we consider either reward\nmodeling or a class of novel direct policy learning objectives based on\nimportance weighted policy gradients. With this technique, we see gains in\ndomains with ground-truth rewards (code generation) as well as implicit rewards\ndefined by preference data, even outperforming finetuning in data-limited\nregimes.

Previous approaches have primarily utilized\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) via online RL methods such as\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Recently, offline methods such as Sequence\nLikelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nemerged as attractive alternatives, offering improvements in stability and\nscalability while maintaining competitive performance. SLiC refines its loss\nfunction using sequence pairs sampled from a supervised fine-tuned (SFT)\npolicy, while DPO directly optimizes language models based on preference data,\nforegoing the need for a separate reward model. However, the maximum likelihood\nestimator (MLE) of the target optimal policy requires labeled preference pairs\nsampled from that policy. DPO's lack of a reward model constrains its ability\nto sample preference pairs from the optimal policy, and SLiC is restricted to\nsampling preference pairs only from the SFT policy. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel approach called Statistical Rejection\nSampling Optimization (RSO) that aims to source preference data from the target\noptimal policy using rejection sampling, enabling a more accurate estimation of\nthe optimal policy. We also propose a unified framework that enhances the loss\nfunctions used in both SLiC and DPO from a preference modeling standpoint.\nThrough extensive experiments across three diverse tasks, we demonstrate that\nRSO consistently outperforms both SLiC and DPO on evaluations from both Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) and human raters.",

Among recent methods,\nGRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as\nDeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In\nthis work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and\nanalyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection\nsampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples,\nyields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal\nthat GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely\nincorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by\nthis insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient\nthat filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples.\nReinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight\nyet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a\nrobust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should\nfocus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather\nthan relying on them indiscriminately.

The idea is to learn\na simple linear function on a model's embedding space that can be used to\nreweight candidate completions.

However, current benchmarks for code synthesis, such\nas HumanEval, MBPP, and DS-1000, are predominantly oriented towards\nintroductory tasks on algorithm and data science, insufficiently satisfying\nchallenging requirements prevalent in real-world coding. To fill this gap, we\npropose NaturalCodeBench (NCB), a challenging code benchmark designed to mirror\nthe complexity and variety of scenarios in real coding tasks. NCB comprises 402\nhigh-quality problems in Python and Java, meticulously selected from natural\nuser queries from online coding services, covering 6 different domains. Noting\nthe extraordinary difficulty in creating testing cases for real-world queries,\nwe also introduce a semi-automated pipeline to enhance the efficiency of test\ncase construction. Comparing with manual solutions, it achieves an efficiency\nincrease of more than 4 times. Our systematic experiments on 39 LLMs find that\nperformance gaps on NCB between models with close HumanEval scores could still\nbe significant, indicating a lack of focus on practical code synthesis\nscenarios or over-specified optimization on HumanEval. On the other hand, even\nthe best-performing GPT-4 is still far from satisfying on NCB. The evaluation\ntoolkit and development set are available at\nhttps://github.com/THUDM/NaturalCodeBench.",

With the ability to follow instructions, current\nLLMs can be prompted to generate code solutions given detailed descriptions in\nnatural language. Many research efforts are being devoted to improving the\ncorrectness of LLM-generated code, and many benchmarks are proposed to evaluate\nthe correctness comprehensively. Despite the focus on correctness, the time\nefficiency of LLM-generated code solutions is under-explored. Current\ncorrectness benchmarks are not suitable for time efficiency evaluation since\ntheir test cases cannot well distinguish the time efficiency of different code\nsolutions. Besides, the current execution time measurement is not stable and\ncomprehensive, threatening the validity of the time efficiency evaluation.\n  To address the challenges in the time efficiency evaluation of code\ngeneration, we propose COFFE, a code generation benchmark for evaluating the\ntime efficiency of LLM-generated code solutions. COFFE contains 398 and 358\nproblems for function-level and file-level code generation, respectively. To\nimprove the distinguishability, we design a novel stressful test case\ngeneration approach with contracts and two new formats of test cases to improve\nthe accuracy of generation. For the time evaluation metric, we propose\nefficienct@k based on CPU instruction count to ensure a stable and solid\ncomparison between different solutions. We evaluate 14 popular LLMs on COFFE\nand identify four findings. Based on the findings, we draw some implications\nfor LLM researchers and software practitioners to facilitate future research\nand usage of LLMs in code generation.",

However, existing code generation\nbenchmarks fail to capture the diverse feedback encountered in multi-turn\ninteractions, limiting our ability to evaluate LLMs in these contexts. To\naddress this gap, we present a set of novel benchmarks that explicitly model\nthe quality of feedback provided to code generation LLMs. Our contributions are\nthreefold: First, we introduce CONVCODEWORLD, a novel and reproducible\nenvironment for benchmarking interactive code generation. CONVCODEWORLD\nsimulates 9 distinct interactive code generation scenarios while systematically\ncombining three types of feedback: (a) compilation feedback; (b) execution\nfeedback with varying test coverage; (c) verbal feedback generated by GPT-4o\nwith different levels of expertise. Second, we introduce CONVCODEBENCH, a fast,\nstatic version of benchmark that uses pre-generated feedback logs, eliminating\nthe need for costly dynamic verbal feedback generation while maintaining strong\nSpearman's rank correlations (0.82 to 0.99) with CONVCODEWORLD. Third,\nextensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs including\nR1-Distill on CONVCODEWORLD reveal key insights: (a) LLM performance varies\nsignificantly based on the feedback provided; (b) Weaker LLMs, with sufficient\nfeedback, can outperform single-turn results of state-of-the-art LLMs without\nfeedback; (c) Training on a specific feedback combination can limit an LLM's\nability to utilize unseen combinations; (d) LLMs solve problems in fewer turns\n(high MRR) may not solve as many problems overall (high Recall), and vice\nversa.

This has led to the development of specialized LLMs for software\nengineering, known as Code LLMs. A considerable portion of Code LLMs is derived\nfrom general LLMs through model fine-tuning. As a result, Code LLMs are often\nupdated frequently and their performance can be influenced by the base LLMs.\nHowever, there is currently a lack of systematic investigation into Code LLMs\nand their performance. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive survey and\nanalysis of the types of Code LLMs and their differences in performance\ncompared to general LLMs. We aim to address three questions: (1) What LLMs are\nspecifically designed for software engineering tasks, and what is the\nrelationship between these Code LLMs? (2) Do Code LLMs really outperform\ngeneral LLMs in software engineering tasks? (3) Which LLMs are more proficient\nin different software engineering tasks? To answer these questions, we first\ncollect relevant literature and work from five major databases and open-source\ncommunities, resulting in 134 works for analysis. Next, we categorize the Code\nLLMs based on their publishers and examine their relationships with general\nLLMs and among themselves. Furthermore, we investigate the performance\ndifferences between general LLMs and Code LLMs in various software engineering\ntasks to demonstrate the impact of base models and Code LLMs. Finally, we\ncomprehensively maintained the performance of LLMs across multiple mainstream\nbenchmarks to identify the best-performing LLMs for each software engineering\ntask.

Moreover, relying exclusively on correctness\nas the guiding metric renders LLMs susceptible to data contamination.\nTherefore, this paper proposes the RACE benchmark, which comprehensively\nevaluates the quality of code generated by LLMs across 4 dimensions:\nReadability, mAintainability, Correctness, and Efficiency. Specifically,\nconsidering the demand-dependent nature of dimensions beyond correctness, we\ndesign various types of user requirements for each dimension to assess the\nmodel's ability to generate correct code that also meets user demands. We\nanalyze 28 representative LLMs based on RACE and find that: 1) current\ncorrectness-centric benchmarks fail to capture the multifaceted requirements of\ncode in real-world scenarios, while RACE provides a comprehensive evaluation\nthat reveals the defects of LLMs across multiple dimensions; 2) the RACE\nbenchmark serves as an effective tool for resisting the risk of data\ncontamination; 3) even the most advanced code LLMs still encounter significant\nchallenges in customized requirements involving complex instructions; 4) most\nLLMs exhibit an inherent preference for specific coding style.

With the ability to follow instructions, current\nLLMs can be prompted to generate code solutions given detailed descriptions in\nnatural language. Many research efforts are being devoted to improving the\ncorrectness of LLM-generated code, and many benchmarks are proposed to evaluate\nthe correctness comprehensively. Despite the focus on correctness, the time\nefficiency of LLM-generated code solutions is under-explored. Current\ncorrectness benchmarks are not suitable for time efficiency evaluation since\ntheir test cases cannot well distinguish the time efficiency of different code\nsolutions. Besides, the current execution time measurement is not stable and\ncomprehensive, threatening the validity of the time efficiency evaluation.\n  To address the challenges in the time efficiency evaluation of code\ngeneration, we propose COFFE, a code generation benchmark for evaluating the\ntime efficiency of LLM-generated code solutions. COFFE contains 398 and 358\nproblems for function-level and file-level code generation, respectively. To\nimprove the distinguishability, we design a novel stressful test case\ngeneration approach with contracts and two new formats of test cases to improve\nthe accuracy of generation. For the time evaluation metric, we propose\nefficienct@k based on CPU instruction count to ensure a stable and solid\ncomparison between different solutions. We evaluate 14 popular LLMs on COFFE\nand identify four findings. Based on the findings, we draw some implications\nfor LLM researchers and software practitioners to facilitate future research\nand usage of LLMs in code generation.",

Moreover, relying exclusively on correctness\nas the guiding metric renders LLMs susceptible to data contamination.\nTherefore, this paper proposes the RACE benchmark, which comprehensively\nevaluates the quality of code generated by LLMs across 4 dimensions:\nReadability, mAintainability, Correctness, and Efficiency. Specifically,\nconsidering the demand-dependent nature of dimensions beyond correctness, we\ndesign various types of user requirements for each dimension to assess the\nmodel's ability to generate correct code that also meets user demands. We\nanalyze 28 representative LLMs based on RACE and find that: 1) current\ncorrectness-centric benchmarks fail to capture the multifaceted requirements of\ncode in real-world scenarios, while RACE provides a comprehensive evaluation\nthat reveals the defects of LLMs across multiple dimensions; 2) the RACE\nbenchmark serves as an effective tool for resisting the risk of data\ncontamination; 3) even the most advanced code LLMs still encounter significant\nchallenges in customized requirements involving complex instructions; 4) most\nLLMs exhibit an inherent preference for specific coding style. These findings\nhighlight the need for a multidimensional evaluation of code LLMs, emphasizing\nmetrics beyond correctness for real-world applications.

Second, we introduce CONVCODEBENCH, a fast,\nstatic version of benchmark that uses pre-generated feedback logs, eliminating\nthe need for costly dynamic verbal feedback generation while maintaining strong\nSpearman's rank correlations (0.82 to 0.99) with CONVCODEWORLD. Third,\nextensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs including\nR1-Distill on CONVCODEWORLD reveal key insights: (a) LLM performance varies\nsignificantly based on the feedback provided; (b) Weaker LLMs, with sufficient\nfeedback, can outperform single-turn results of state-of-the-art LLMs without\nfeedback; (c) Training on a specific feedback combination can limit an LLM's\nability to utilize unseen combinations; (d) LLMs solve problems in fewer turns\n(high MRR) may not solve as many problems overall (high Recall), and vice\nversa.

            "abstract": "Code generation has largely improved development efficiency in the era of\nlarge language models (LLMs). With the ability to follow instructions, current\nLLMs can be prompted to generate code solutions given detailed descriptions in\nnatural language. Many research efforts are being devoted to improving the\ncorrectness of LLM-generated code, and many benchmarks are proposed to evaluate\nthe correctness comprehensively. Despite the focus on correctness, the time\nefficiency of LLM-generated code solutions is under-explored. Current\ncorrectness benchmarks are not suitable for time efficiency evaluation since\ntheir test cases cannot well distinguish the time efficiency of different code\nsolutions. Besides, the current execution time measurement is not stable and\ncomprehensive, threatening the validity of the time efficiency evaluation.\n  To address the challenges in the time efficiency evaluation of code\ngeneration, we propose COFFE, a code generation benchmark for evaluating the\ntime efficiency of LLM-generated code solutions. COFFE contains 398 and 358\nproblems for function-level and file-level code generation, respectively. To\nimprove the distinguishability, we design a novel stressful test case\ngeneration approach with contracts and two new formats of test cases to improve\nthe accuracy of generation. For the time evaluation metric, we propose\nefficienct@k based on CPU instruction count to ensure a stable and solid\ncomparison between different solutions. We evaluate 14 popular LLMs on COFFE\nand identify four findings. Based on the findings, we draw some implications\nfor LLM researchers and software practitioners to facilitate future research\nand usage of LLMs in code generation.",

To address this gap, we introduce OlymMATH, a novel Olympiad-level\nmathematical benchmark, designed to rigorously test the complex reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs. OlymMATH features 200 meticulously curated problems, each\nmanually verified and available in parallel English and Chinese versions. The\nproblems are systematically organized into two distinct difficulty tiers: (1)\nAIME-level problems (easy) that establish a baseline for mathematical reasoning\nassessment, and (2) significantly more challenging problems (hard) designed to\npush the boundaries of current state-of-the-art models. In our benchmark, these\nproblems span four core mathematical fields, each including a verifiable\nnumerical solution to enable objective, rule-based evaluation. Empirical\nresults underscore the significant challenge presented by OlymMATH, with\nstate-of-the-art models including DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini\ndemonstrating notably limited accuracy on the hard subset. Furthermore, the\nbenchmark facilitates comprehensive bilingual assessment of mathematical\nreasoning abilities-a critical dimension that remains largely unaddressed in\nmainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Are the current large AI models indeed capable of generalized problem\nsolving as humans do? A systematic analysis of AI capabilities for joint vision\nand text reasoning, however, is missing in the current scientific literature.\nIn this paper, we make an effort towards filling this gap, by evaluating\nstate-of-the-art LVLMs on their mathematical and algorithmic reasoning\nabilities using visuo-linguistic problems from children's Olympiads.\nSpecifically, we consider problems from the Mathematical Kangaroo (MK)\nOlympiad, which is a popular international competition targeted at children\nfrom grades 1-12, that tests children's deeper mathematical abilities using\npuzzles that are appropriately gauged to their age and skills. Using the\npuzzles from MK, we created a dataset, dubbed SMART-840, consisting of 840\nproblems from years 2020-2024. With our dataset, we analyze LVLMs power on\nmathematical reasoning; their responses on our puzzles offer a direct way to\ncompare against that of children. Our results show that modern LVLMs do\ndemonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning skills in solving problems for\nhigher grades, but lack the foundations to correctly answer problems designed\nfor younger children. Further analysis shows that there is no significant\ncorrelation between the reasoning capabilities of AI models and that of young\nchildren, and their capabilities appear to be based on a different type of\nreasoning than the cumulative knowledge that underlies children's mathematics\nand logic skills.",

Our framework includes 3 components:\ngenerating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that\ngenerates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing\nheuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage\nfine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model\nto generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that\nencourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover.

However,\ncurrent verifier models in LLMs often rely on supervised fine-tuning without\ntemporal difference learning such as Q-learning. This paper introduces\nVerifierQ, a novel approach that integrates Offline Q-learning into LLM\nverifier models. We address three key challenges in applying Q-learning to\nLLMs: (1) handling utterance-level Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), (2)\nmanaging large action spaces, and (3) mitigating overestimation bias. VerifierQ\nintroduces a modified Bellman update for bounded Q-values, incorporates\nImplicit Q-learning (IQL) for efficient action space management, and integrates\na novel Conservative Q-learning (CQL) formulation for balanced Q-value\nestimation. Our method enables parallel Q-value computation and improving\ntraining efficiency. While recent work has explored RL techniques like MCTS for\ngenerators, VerifierQ is among the first to investigate the verifier (critic)\naspect in LLMs through Q-learning. This integration of RL principles into\nverifier models complements existing advancements in generator techniques,\npotentially enabling more robust and adaptive reasoning in LLMs. Experimental\nresults on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate VerifierQ's superior\nperformance compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches, with\nimprovements in efficiency, accuracy and robustness.

In this paper, we study the scaling of\ninference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if\nan LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time\ncompute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?\nAnswering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance\nof LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff\ninference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little\nresearch attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time\ninference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for\na number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms\nto scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based\nverifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a\nresponse adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,\nthe effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute\ncritically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation\nmotivates applying a \"compute-optimal\" scaling strategy, which acts to most\neffectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this\ncompute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute\nscaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a\nFLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model\nattains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to\noutperform a 14x larger model.",

Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, MedAdapter\neffectively adapts the original model by fine-tuning only a small BERT-sized\nadapter to rank candidate solutions generated by LLMs. Experiments demonstrate\nthat MedAdapter effectively adapts both white-box and black-box LLMs in\nbiomedical reasoning, achieving average performance improvements of 25.48% and\n11.31%, respectively, without requiring extensive computational resources or\nsharing data with third parties. MedAdapter also yields superior performance\nwhen combined with train-time adaptation, highlighting a flexible and\ncomplementary solution to existing adaptation methods.

Consequently,\nthese algorithms struggle and become brittle even when samples in the test\ndistribution start to deviate from the ones observed during training. Domain\nadaptation and domain generalization have been studied extensively as\napproaches to address distribution shifts across test and train domains, but\neach has its limitations. Test-time adaptation, a recently emerging learning\nparadigm, combines the benefits of domain adaptation and domain generalization\nby training models only on source data and adapting them to target data during\ntest-time inference. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic\nreview on test-time adaptation, covering more than 400 recent papers. We\nstructure our review by categorizing existing methods into five distinct\ncategories based on what component of the method is adjusted for test-time\nadaptation: the model, the inference, the normalization, the sample, or the\nprompt, providing detailed analysis of each. We further discuss the various\npreparation and adaptation settings for methods within these categories,\noffering deeper insights into the effective deployment for the evaluation of\ndistribution shifts and their real-world application in understanding images,\nvideo and 3D, as well as modalities beyond vision. We close the survey with an\noutlook on emerging research opportunities for test-time adaptation.",

For this approach to succeed, the\nretrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input\nlength grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and\nmemory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these\ncomplications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time,\nusing its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index\nbased on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system\nretrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly,\nretrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient\niteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language\nmodeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest\nneighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a\nGPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size,\nhowever, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time\ntraining for language modeling.",

To investigate the genuine potential of LLMs\nin time series prediction, we introduce three pre-training models with\nidentical architectures but different pre-training strategies.

However, the distribution shift between the training and test data\nchallenges the effectiveness of GNNs. To mitigate this challenge, Test-Time\nTraining (TTT) has been proposed as a promising approach. Traditional TTT\nmethods require a demanding unsupervised training strategy to capture the\ninformation from test to benefit the main task. Inspired by the great\nannotation ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Text-Attributed Graphs\n(TAGs), we propose to enhance the test-time training on graphs with LLMs as\nannotators. In this paper, we design a novel Test-Time Training pipeline,\nLLMTTT, which conducts the test-time adaptation under the annotations by LLMs\non a carefully-selected node set. Specifically, LLMTTT introduces a hybrid\nactive node selection strategy that considers not only node diversity and\nrepresentativeness, but also prediction signals from the pre-trained model.\nGiven annotations from LLMs, a two-stage training strategy is designed to\ntailor the test-time model with the limited and noisy labels. A theoretical\nanalysis ensures the validity of our method and extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed LLMTTT can achieve a significant performance\nimprovement compared to existing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization\nmethods.",

Because only well-resourced\ncorporations can train frontier LLMs, we need robust test-time strategies to\ncontrol such biases. Existing solutions, which instruct the LLM to be fair or\nrobust, rely on the model's implicit understanding of bias. Causality provides\na rich formalism through which we can be explicit about our debiasing\nrequirements. Yet, as we show, a naive application of the standard causal\ndebiasing strategy, counterfactual data augmentation, fails under standard\nassumptions to debias predictions at an individual level at test time. To\naddress this, we develop a stratified notion of debiasing called stratified\ninvariance, which can capture a range of debiasing requirements from population\nlevel to individual level through an additional measurement that stratifies the\npredictions. We present a complete observational test for stratified\ninvariance. Finally, we introduce a data augmentation strategy that guarantees\nstratified invariance at test time under suitable assumptions, together with a\nprompting strategy that encourages stratified invariance in LLMs. We show that\nour prompting strategy, unlike implicit instructions, consistently reduces the\nbias of frontier LLMs across a suite of synthetic and real-world benchmarks\nwithout requiring additional data, finetuning or pre-training.",

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention\nas a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from\nconstructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in\nresponses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data\nconstruction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We\nidentify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the\nconstructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by\nthe presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference\npolicy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically\nsummarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address\nhallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment\n(OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct\nhallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised\nresponses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO\nachieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B:\n13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared\nto the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.

Furthermore, our approach seamlessly extends\nto iterative DPO, yielding a roughly 3\\% improvement with 25\\% online data,\nwhile further reducing training time. These results highlight the potential of\ndata selection strategies for advancing preference optimization.",

As such, QGLMs are\nreceiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science\ncommunities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on\nnear-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are\nproposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the\nperspective of machine learning.

In this context, we explore\ntheir intrinsic relation and their fundamental differences.

Reinforcement learning is a powerful model-free technique\nthat allows an agent, typically a neural network, to learn the best strategy to\nreach a certain goal in a completely a priori unknown environment. However, in\ngeneral, we know something about the quantum system with which the agent is\ninteracting, at least that it follows the rules of quantum mechanics. In\nquantum metrology, we typically have a model for the system, and only some\nparameters of the evolution or the initial state are unknown. We present here a\ngeneral machine learning technique that can optimize the precision of quantum\nsensors, exploiting the knowledge we have on the system through model-aware\nreinforcement learning. This framework has been implemented in the Python\npackage qsensoropt, which is able to optimize a broad class of problems found\nin quantum metrology and quantum parameter estimation. The agent learns an\noptimal adaptive strategy that, based on previous outcomes, decides the next\nmeasurements to perform. We have explored some applications of this technique\nto NV centers and photonic circuits.

How do we update adversarial\nrobustness benchmarks? To address the above issues, we introduce HITL-GAT, a\nsystem based on a general approach to human-in-the-loop generation of\nadversarial texts. HITL-GAT contains four stages in one pipeline: victim model\nconstruction, adversarial example generation, high-quality benchmark\nconstruction, and adversarial robustness evaluation.

In this paper, we propose a new type of\nadversarial attack against NMT models. In this attack, we find a word to be\nadded between two sentences such that the second sentence is ignored and not\ntranslated by the NMT model. The word added between the two sentences is such\nthat the whole adversarial text is natural in the source language. This type of\nattack can be harmful in practical scenarios since the attacker can hide\nmalicious information in the automatic translation made by the target NMT\nmodel. Our experiments show that different NMT models and translation tasks are\nvulnerable to this type of attack.

            "abstract": "In various real-world applications such as machine translation, sentiment\nanalysis, and question answering, a pivotal role is played by NLP models,\nfacilitating efficient communication and decision-making processes in domains\nranging from healthcare to finance. However, a significant challenge is posed\nto the robustness of these natural language processing models by text\nadversarial attacks. These attacks involve the deliberate manipulation of input\ntext to mislead the predictions of the model while maintaining human\ninterpretability. Despite the remarkable performance achieved by\nstate-of-the-art models like BERT in various natural language processing tasks,\nthey are found to remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in the input\ntext. In addressing the vulnerability of text classifiers to adversarial\nattacks, three distinct attack mechanisms are explored in this paper using the\nvictim model BERT: BERT-on-BERT attack, PWWS attack, and Fraud Bargain's Attack\n(FBA). Leveraging the IMDB, AG News, and SST2 datasets, a thorough comparative\nanalysis is conducted to assess the effectiveness of these attacks on the BERT\nclassifier model. It is revealed by the analysis that PWWS emerges as the most\npotent adversary, consistently outperforming other methods across multiple\nevaluation scenarios, thereby emphasizing its efficacy in generating\nadversarial examples for text classification. Through comprehensive\nexperimentation, the performance of these attacks is assessed and the findings\nindicate that the PWWS attack outperforms others, demonstrating lower runtime,\nhigher accuracy, and favorable semantic similarity scores. The key insight of\nthis paper lies in the assessment of the relative performances of three\nprevalent state-of-the-art attack mechanisms.",

In our attack, the\nadversary aims to craft meaning-preserving adversarial examples whose\ntranslations in the target language by the NMT model belong to a different\nclass than the original translations. Unlike previous attacks, our new approach\nhas a more substantial effect on the translation by altering the overall\nmeaning, which then leads to a different class determined by an oracle\nclassifier. To evaluate the robustness of NMT models to our attack, we propose\nenhancements to existing black-box word-replacement-based attacks by\nincorporating output translations of the target NMT model and the output logits\nof a classifier within the attack process. Extensive experiments, including a\ncomparison with existing untargeted attacks, show that our attack is\nconsiderably more successful in altering the class of the output translation\nand has more effect on the translation. This new paradigm can reveal the\nvulnerabilities of NMT systems by focusing on the class of translation rather\nthan the mere translation quality as studied traditionally.",

However, their performance in 3D\nspatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains\nlimited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images\nas inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely\nvision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on\nvisual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates\nthe limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary\nshortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene\nand individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual\nprompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the\nglobal-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding\nof indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nimage from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the\nBEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames\nwith markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over\nclosed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video\ndataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks.\nSurprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently\nimprove during inference, even without object marker prompting and BEV image as\nexplicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs\ndevelop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a\nseamless approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.",

Due to the high density\nof visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating\ntask-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to\nsegment all objects and consider their features as scene representations.\nHowever, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information\nand missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we\npropose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies\ntask-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks,\nfollowed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained\ndetails in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the\nattention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input.\nIt then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive\nself-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected\nfine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene\nunderstanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room\nunderstanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene\nunderstanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption.\nExperiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene\nunderstanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks.

While humans naturally comprehend the intricate relationships\nbetween objects and variations through a multisensory system, artificial\nintelligence (AI) systems have yet to fully replicate this capacity. To bridge\nthis gap, it becomes essential to incorporate multiple modalities. Models that\ncan seamlessly integrate and reason across these modalities are known as\nfoundation models (FMs). The development of FMs for 2D modalities, such as\nimages and text, has seen significant progress, driven by the abundant\navailability of large-scale datasets. However, the 3D domain has lagged due to\nthe scarcity of labelled data and high computational overheads. In response,\nrecent research has begun to explore the potential of applying FMs to 3D tasks,\novercoming these challenges by leveraging existing 2D knowledge. Additionally,\nlanguage, with its capacity for abstract reasoning and description of the\nenvironment, offers a promising avenue for enhancing 3D understanding through\nlarge pre-trained language models (LLMs). Despite the rapid development and\nadoption of FMs for 3D vision tasks in recent years, there remains a gap in\ncomprehensive and in-depth literature reviews. This article aims to address\nthis gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods\nthat utilize FMs for 3D visual understanding. We start by reviewing various\nstrategies employed in the building of various 3D FMs. Then we categorize and\nsummarize use of different FMs for tasks such as perception tasks.

While many studies highlight\nthat large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space,\nthey only focus on static spatial relationships, and not dynamic awareness of\nmotion and space, i.e., reasoning about the effect of egocentric and object\nmotions on spatial relationships. Manually annotating such object and camera\nmovements is expensive. Hence, we introduce SAT, a simulated spatial aptitude\ntraining dataset comprising both static and dynamic spatial reasoning across\n175K question-answer (QA) pairs and 20K scenes. Complementing this, we also\nconstruct a small (150 image-QAs) yet challenging dynamic spatial test set\nusing real-world images. Leveraging our SAT datasets and 6 existing static\nspatial benchmarks, we systematically investigate what improves both static and\ndynamic spatial awareness. Our results reveal that simulations are surprisingly\neffective at imparting spatial aptitude to MLMs that translate to real images.\nWe show that perfect annotations in simulation are more effective than existing\napproaches of pseudo-annotating real images. For instance, SAT training\nimproves a LLaVA-13B model by an average 11% and a LLaVA-Video-7B model by an\naverage 8% on multiple spatial benchmarks, including our real-image dynamic\ntest set and spatial reasoning on long videos -- even outperforming some large\nproprietary models.

While current research has predominantly focused on the\nbenchmarking of text-to-image (T2I) models, we propose a more comprehensive\nevaluation that includes \\textit{both} T2I and Large Language Models (LLMs). As\nspatial relations are naturally understood in a visuo-spatial manner, we\ndevelop an approach to convert LLM outputs into an image, thereby allowing us\nto evaluate both T2I models and LLMs \\textit{visually}. We examined the spatial\nrelation understanding of 8 prominent generative models (3 T2I models and 5\nLLMs) on a set of 10 common prepositions, as well as assess the feasibility of\nautomatic evaluation methods. Surprisingly, we found that T2I models only\nachieve subpar performance despite their impressive general image-generation\nabilities. Even more surprisingly, our results show that LLMs are significantly\nmore accurate than T2I models in generating spatial relations, despite being\nprimarily trained on textual data. We examined reasons for model failures and\nhighlight gaps that can be filled to enable more spatially faithful\ngenerations.",

However, their performance in 3D\nspatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains\nlimited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images\nas inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely\nvision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on\nvisual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates\nthe limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary\nshortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene\nand individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual\nprompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the\nglobal-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding\nof indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nimage from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the\nBEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames\nwith markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over\nclosed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video\ndataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks.\nSurprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently\nimprove during inference, even without object marker prompting and BEV image as\nexplicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs\ndevelop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a\nseamless approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.",

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are omnipresent, however their practical\ndeployment is challenging due to their ever increasing computational and memory\ndemands. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more\ncompute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,\ngenerally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost\nof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it\nimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a\nlightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several\ncomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)\nlow-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a\ndowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)\ncheckpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,\nleading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen\nas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model\ncan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied\nacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices\nquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with\nmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families\nand validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method\noutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the\nsame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.\nSpecifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of\nmemory.

However, they face challenges in\nmanaging their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware\ntraining (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit\nrepresentations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to\nsubstantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient\nQuantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm.\nEfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all\nparameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters\n(E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable\ndirect training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy\nloss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization.\nE2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end,\nfurther improving the performance of quantized models by considering\ninteractions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nEfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of\nmodels, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with\nscales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance,\nEfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41\nhours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full\nprecision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

However, the\ncomputational demands of LLMs are immense, and the energy resources required to\nrun them are often limited. For instance, popular models like GPT-3, with 175\nbillion parameters and a storage requirement of 350 GB, present significant\nchallenges for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices and embedded\nsystems. These systems often lack the computational capacity to handle such\nlarge models. Quantization, a technique that reduces the precision of model\nvalues to a smaller set of discrete values, offers a promising solution by\nreducing the size of LLMs and accelerating inference. In this research, we\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of quantization techniques within the machine\nlearning field, with a particular focus on their application to LLMs. We begin\nby exploring the mathematical theory of quantization, followed by a review of\ncommon quantization methods and how they are implemented. Furthermore, we\nexamine several prominent quantization methods applied to LLMs, detailing their\nalgorithms and performance outcomes.",

Since LLM abilities\nemerge with scale, smaller LLMs are more sensitive to quantization. In this\npaper, we explore how quantization affects smaller LLMs' ability to perform\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), specifically in longer contexts. We chose\npersonalization for evaluation because it is a challenging domain to perform\nusing RAG as it requires long-context reasoning over multiple documents. We\ncompare the original FP16 and the quantized INT4 performance of multiple 7B and\n8B LLMs on two tasks while progressively increasing the number of retrieved\ndocuments to test how quantized models fare against longer contexts. To better\nunderstand the effect of retrieval, we evaluate three retrieval models in our\nexperiments. Our findings reveal that if a 7B LLM performs the task well,\nquantization does not impair its performance and long-context reasoning\ncapabilities. We conclude that it is possible to utilize RAG with quantized\nsmaller LLMs.",

            "abstract": "Video dubbing aims to synthesize realistic, lip-synced videos from a\nreference video and a driving audio signal. Although existing methods can\naccurately generate mouth shapes driven by audio, they often fail to preserve\nidentity-specific features, largely because they do not effectively capture the\nnuanced interplay between audio cues and the visual attributes of reference\nidentity . As a result, the generated outputs frequently lack fidelity in\nreproducing the unique textural and structural details of the reference\nidentity. To address these limitations, we propose IPTalker, a novel and robust\nframework for video dubbing that achieves seamless alignment between driving\naudio and reference identity while ensuring both lip-sync accuracy and\nhigh-fidelity identity preservation. At the core of IPTalker is a\ntransformer-based alignment mechanism designed to dynamically capture and model\nthe correspondence between audio features and reference images, thereby\nenabling precise, identity-aware audio-visual integration. Building on this\nalignment, a motion warping strategy further refines the results by spatially\ndeforming reference images to match the target audio-driven configuration. A\ndedicated refinement process then mitigates occlusion artifacts and enhances\nthe preservation of fine-grained textures, such as mouth details and skin\nfeatures. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that\nIPTalker consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of realism, lip\nsynchronization, and identity retention, establishing a new state of the art\nfor high-quality, identity-consistent video dubbing.",

It is an important task in\nvideo generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper\npushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been\nresolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case\nfinetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based\ncontrol scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V\nmodel to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by\nprior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs\nidentity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be\ndecomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic\nfeatures. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial\nextractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent\nspace, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These\nfeatures are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate\ntraining challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency\nperspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency\ndetails and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability\nto preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy\nto leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a\nvanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an\noptimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our\nConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides\ntowards more effective IPT2V. Code: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID.",

            "abstract": "There is strong interest in the generation of synthetic video imagery of\npeople talking for various purposes, including entertainment, communication,\ntraining, and advertisement. With the development of deep fake generation\nmodels, synthetic video imagery will soon be visually indistinguishable to the\nnaked eye from a naturally capture video. In addition, many methods are\ncontinuing to improve to avoid more careful, forensic visual analysis. Some\ndeep fake videos are produced through the use of facial puppetry, which\ndirectly controls the head and face of the synthetic image through the\nmovements of the actor, allow the actor to 'puppet' the image of another. In\nthis paper, we address the question of whether one person's movements can be\ndistinguished from the original speaker by controlling the visual appearance of\nthe speaker but transferring the behavior signals from another source. We\nconduct a study by comparing synthetic imagery that: 1) originates from a\ndifferent person speaking a different utterance, 2) originates from the same\nperson speaking a different utterance, and 3) originates from a different\nperson speaking the same utterance. Our study shows that synthetic videos in\nall three cases are seen as less real and less engaging than the original\nsource video. Our results indicate that there could be a behavioral signature\nthat is detectable from a person's movements that is separate from their visual\nappearance, and that this behavioral signature could be used to distinguish a\ndeep fake from a properly captured video.",

It is an important task in\nvideo generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper\npushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been\nresolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case\nfinetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based\ncontrol scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V\nmodel to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by\nprior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs\nidentity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be\ndecomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic\nfeatures. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial\nextractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent\nspace, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These\nfeatures are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate\ntraining challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency\nperspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency\ndetails and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability\nto preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy\nto leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a\nvanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an\noptimal control solution for DiT-based models. Thanks to this scheme, our\nConsisID generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos, making strides\ntowards more effective IPT2V. Code: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/ConsisID.",

In this\nstudy, we present \\textbf{ID-Animator}, a zero-shot human-video generation\napproach that can perform personalized video generation given a single\nreference facial image without further training. ID-Animator inherits existing\ndiffusion-based video generation backbones with a face adapter to encode the\nID-relevant embeddings from learnable facial latent queries. To facilitate the\nextraction of identity information in video generation, we introduce an\nID-oriented dataset construction pipeline that incorporates unified human\nattributes and action captioning techniques from a constructed facial image\npool. Based on this pipeline, a random reference training strategy is further\ndevised to precisely capture the ID-relevant embeddings with an ID-preserving\nloss, thus improving the fidelity and generalization capacity of our model for\nID-specific video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof ID-Animator to generate personalized human videos over previous models.\nMoreover, our method is highly compatible with popular pre-trained T2V models\nlike animatediff and various community backbone models, showing high\nextendability in real-world applications for video generation where identity\npreservation is highly desired.

Here, we investigate how self-attention query features (a.k.a.\nQ features) simultaneously govern motion, structure, and identity and examine\nthe challenges arising when these representations interact. Our analysis\nreveals that Q affects not only layout, but that during denoising Q also has a\nstrong effect on subject identity, making it hard to transfer motion without\nthe side-effect of transferring identity. Understanding this dual role enabled\nus to control query feature injection (Q injection) and demonstrate two\napplications: (1) a zero-shot motion transfer method that is 20 times more\nefficient than existing approaches, and (2) a training-free technique for\nconsistent multi-shot video generation, where characters maintain identity\nacross multiple video shots while Q injection enhances motion fidelity.",

Unlike traditional agents, large language\nmodel-based agents (LLM agents) have emerged as a promising paradigm for\nachieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their superior reasoning\nand generalization capabilities. Effective planning is crucial for the success\nof LLM agents in real-world tasks, making it a highly pursued topic in the\ncommunity. Current planning methods typically translate tasks into executable\naction sequences. However, determining a feasible or optimal sequence for\ncomplex tasks with multiple constraints at fine granularity, which often\nrequires compositing long chains of heterogeneous actions, remains challenging.\nThis paper introduces Planning with Multi-Constraints (PMC), a zero-shot\nmethodology for collaborative LLM-based multi-agent systems that simplifies\ncomplex task planning with constraints by decomposing it into a hierarchy of\nsubordinate tasks. Each subtask is then mapped into executable actions. PMC was\nassessed on two constraint-intensive benchmarks, TravelPlanner and API-Bank.\nNotably, PMC achieved an average 42.68% success rate on TravelPlanner,\nsignificantly higher than GPT-4 (2.92%), and outperforming GPT-4 with ReAct on\nAPI-Bank by 13.64%, showing the immense potential of integrating LLM with\nmulti-agent systems. We also show that PMC works with small LLM as the planning\ncore, e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B.",

Furthermore, planning ability is a crucial\ncomponent of an LLM-based agent, which generally entails achieving a desired\ngoal from an initial state. This paper investigates enhancing the planning\nabilities of LLMs through instruction tuning, referred to as agent training.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that utilizing expert-level trajectory for\ninstruction-tuning LLMs effectively enhances their planning capabilities.\nHowever, existing work primarily focuses on synthesizing trajectories from\nmanually designed planning tasks and environments. The labor-intensive nature\nof creating these environments and tasks impedes the generation of sufficiently\nvaried and extensive trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper\nexplores the automated synthesis of diverse environments and a gradual range of\nplanning tasks, from easy to difficult. We introduce a framework, AgentGen,\nthat leverages LLMs first to generate environments and subsequently generate\nplanning tasks conditioned on these environments. Specifically, to improve\nenvironmental diversity, we propose using an inspiration corpus composed of\nvarious domain-specific text segments as the context for synthesizing\nenvironments. Moreover, to increase the difficulty diversity of generated\nplanning tasks, we propose a bidirectional evolution method, Bi-Evol, that\nevolves planning tasks from easier and harder directions to synthesize a task\nset with a smoother difficulty curve. The evaluation results derived from\nAgentBoard show that AgentGen greatly improves LLMs' planning ability, e.g.,\nthe AgentGen instruction-tuned Llama-3.1-8B surpasses GPT-3.5 in overall\nperformance. Moreover, the AgentGen-tuned Llama-3.1-70B model achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in planning tasks. Project page:\nhttps://agent-gen.github.io/.",

This challenge is particularly\npronounced in wireless and digitalized energy networks, where users'\nrequirements have largely not been taken into consideration due to the lack of\na common language between users and machines. The emergence of powerful large\nlanguage models (LLMs) marks a radical departure from traditional\nsystem-centric methods into more advanced user-centric approaches by providing\na natural communication interface between users and devices. In this paper, for\nthe first time, we introduce a novel architecture for resource scheduling\nproblems by constructing three LLM agents to convert an arbitrary user's voice\nrequest (VRQ) into a resource allocation vector. Specifically, we design an LLM\nintent recognition agent to translate the request into an optimization problem\n(OP), an LLM OP parameter identification agent, and an LLM OP solving agent. To\nevaluate system performance, we construct a database of typical VRQs in the\ncontext of electric vehicle (EV) charging. As a proof of concept, we primarily\nuse Llama 3 8B. Through testing with different prompt engineering scenarios,\nthe obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture.\nThe conducted performance analysis allows key insights to be extracted. For\ninstance, having a larger set of candidate OPs to model the real-world problem\nmight degrade the final performance because of a higher recognition/OP\nclassification noise level. All results and codes are open source.",

The scrum based approach\nexecutes an automated process of requirements gathering, user story mapping,\nfeature identification, task decomposition and finally generates questions and\nsearch terms for seeking out domain specific information to assist with task\ncompletion. The shortcut approach looks at most recent snapshot of the current\nand desired state and generates the next most reasonable task to do in order to\nget to the desired state as quickly as possible.

This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of\nthe scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic\nnature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is\ndemonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck\nscheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone\nTransformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key\ncontribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which\nshowcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce\nrobust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to\ncontainer port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to\nvarious dynamic scheduling challenges.

This paper proposes an entropy-driven model\nselection approach and DAW-Transformer, which stands for Dynamic\nAttribute-Aware Transformer, to integrate all attributes with a dynamic window\nfor better accuracy.\n  Design/methodology/approach - This paper introduces a novel next-activity\nprediction approach that uses process entropy to assess the complexity of event\nlogs and dynamically select the most suitable ML model. A new transformer-based\narchitecture with multi-head attention and dynamic windowing mechanism,\nDAW-Transformer, is proposed to capture long-range dependencies and utilize all\nrelevant event log attributes. Experiments were conducted on six public\ndatasets, and the performance was evaluated with process entropy.\n  Finding - The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach across\nthese publicly available datasets. DAW-Transformer achieved superior\nperformance, especially on high-entropy datasets such as Sepsis exceeding\nLimited window Multi-Transformers by 4.69% and a benchmark CNN-LSTM-SAtt model\nby 3.07%. For low-entropy datasets like Road Traffic Fine, simpler, more\ninterpretable algorithms like Random Forest performed nearly as well as the\nmore complex DAW-Transformer and offered better handling of imbalanced data and\nimproved explainability.\n  Originality/ value - This work's novelty lies in the proposed\nDAW-Transformer, with a dynamic window and considering all relevant attributes.\nAlso, entropy-driven selection methods offer a robust, accurate, and\ninterpretable solution for next-activity prediction.",

Based on a\ncomprehensive review of 126 papers, this paper investigates eight categories\nbased on the unique applications of LLMs in addressing various aspects of\nplanning problems: language translation, plan generation, model construction,\nmulti-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool\nintegration, and brain-inspired planning. For each category, we articulate the\nissues considered and existing gaps. A critical insight resulting from our\nreview is that the true potential of LLMs unfolds when they are integrated with\ntraditional symbolic planners, pointing towards a promising neuro-symbolic\napproach. This approach effectively combines the generative aspects of LLMs\nwith the precision of classical planning methods. By synthesizing insights from\nexisting literature, we underline the potential of this integration to address\ncomplex planning challenges. Our goal is to encourage the ICAPS community to\nrecognize the complementary strengths of LLMs and symbolic planners, advocating\nfor a direction in automated planning that leverages these synergistic\ncapabilities to develop more advanced and intelligent planning systems.",

However, for planning tasks\nwith limited prior data (e.g., blocks world, advanced travel planning), the\nperformance of LLMs, including proprietary models like GPT and Gemini, is poor.\nThis paper investigates the impact of fine-tuning on the planning capabilities\nof LLMs, revealing that LLMs can achieve strong performance in planning through\nsubstantial (tens of thousands of specific examples) fine-tuning.

Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that CMDS-l, a baseline method combining CMDS with\nlanguage embeddings, outperforms random sampling.

Two key components of learned image compression are the\nentropy model of the latent representations and the encoding/decoding network\narchitectures. Various models have been proposed, such as autoregressive,\nsoftmax, logistic mixture, Gaussian mixture, and Laplacian. Existing schemes\nonly use one of these models. However, due to the vast diversity of images, it\nis not optimal to use one model for all images, even different regions within\none image. In this paper, we propose a more flexible discretized\nGaussian-Laplacian-Logistic mixture model (GLLMM) for the latent\nrepresentations, which can adapt to different contents in different images and\ndifferent regions of one image more accurately and efficiently, given the same\ncomplexity. Besides, in the encoding/decoding network design part, we propose a\nconcatenated residual blocks (CRB), where multiple residual blocks are serially\nconnected with additional shortcut connections. The CRB can improve the\nlearning ability of the network, which can further improve the compression\nperformance. Experimental results using the Kodak, Tecnick-100 and Tecnick-40\ndatasets show that the proposed scheme outperforms all the leading\nlearning-based methods and existing compression standards including VVC intra\ncoding (4:4:4 and 4:2:0) in terms of the PSNR and MS-SSIM.

It encodes a transformed latent\nrepresentation using a static distribution whose parameters are learned during\ntraining. However, the actual distribution of the latent data may vary wildly\nacross different inputs. The static distribution attempts to encompass all\npossible input distributions, thus fitting none of them particularly well. This\nunfortunate phenomenon, sometimes known as the amortization gap, results in\nsuboptimal compression. To address this issue, we propose a method that\ndynamically adapts the encoding distribution to match the latent data\ndistribution for a specific input. First, our model estimates a better encoding\ndistribution for a given input. This distribution is then compressed and\ntransmitted as an additional side-information bitstream. Finally, the decoder\nreconstructs the encoding distribution and uses it to decompress the\ncorresponding latent data. Our method achieves a Bj{\\o}ntegaard-Delta (BD)-rate\ngain of -7.10% on the Kodak test dataset when applied to the standard\nfully-factorized architecture. Furthermore, considering computational\ncomplexity, the transform used by our method is an order of magnitude cheaper\nin terms of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations compared to related\nside-information methods such as the scale hyperprior.",

With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs),\npreliminary attempts have been made to leverage the extensive prior knowledge\nembedded in these pretrained models to enhance lossless image compression,\nparticularly by improving the entropy model. However, a significant challenge\nremains in bridging the gap between the textual prior knowledge within LLMs and\nlossless image compression. To tackle this challenge and unlock the potential\nof LLMs, this paper introduces a novel paradigm for lossless image compression\nthat incorporates LLMs with visual prompts. Specifically, we first generate a\nlossy reconstruction of the input image as visual prompts, from which we\nextract features to serve as visual embeddings for the LLM. The residual\nbetween the original image and the lossy reconstruction is then fed into the\nLLM along with these visual embeddings, enabling the LLM to function as an\nentropy model to predict the probability distribution of the residual.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate our method\nachieves state-of-the-art compression performance, surpassing both traditional\nand learning-based lossless image codecs. Furthermore, our approach can be\neasily extended to images from other domains, such as medical and screen\ncontent images, achieving impressive performance. These results highlight the\npotential of LLMs for lossless image compression and may inspire further\nresearch in related directions.",

In this paper, we\nmake progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by\nviewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from a source\ndistribution to a target distribution. Under this new interpretation, these\nmethods seek to transport corrupted images (source) to the natural image\ndistribution (target). We argue that current methods' characteristic artifacts\nare caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor\nestimates of the source distribution. We show that calibrating the text\nconditioning of the source distribution can produce high-quality generation and\ntranslation results with little extra overhead. Our method can be easily\napplied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized\nmethods. We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-based NeRF\noptimization, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion\ngeneration, and 3D sketch-to-real.

We\npropose W1KP, a human-calibrated measure of variability in a set of images,\nbootstrapped from existing image-pair perceptual distances. Current datasets do\nnot cover recent diffusion models, thus we curate three test sets for\nevaluation. Our best perceptual distance outperforms nine baselines by up to 18\npoints in accuracy, and our calibration matches graded human judgements 78% of\nthe time.

In clinical dermatology, classification models can detect malignant\nlesions on patients' skin using only RGB images as input. However, most\nlearning-based methods employ data acquired from dermoscopic datasets on\ntraining, which are large and validated by a gold standard. Clinical models aim\nto deal with classification on users' smartphone cameras that do not contain\nthe corresponding resolution provided by dermoscopy. Also, clinical\napplications bring new challenges. It can contain captures from uncontrolled\nenvironments, skin tone variations, viewpoint changes, noises in data and\nlabels, and unbalanced classes. A possible alternative would be to use transfer\nlearning to deal with the clinical images. However, as the number of samples is\nlow, it can cause degradations on the model's performance; the source\ndistribution used in training differs from the test set. This work aims to\nevaluate the gap between dermoscopic and clinical samples and understand how\nthe dataset variations impact training. It assesses the main differences\nbetween distributions that disturb the model's prediction. Finally, from\nexperiments on different architectures, we argue how to combine the data from\ndivergent distributions, decreasing the impact on the model's final accuracy.",

To this end,\nthis work presents the first investigation of lossless compression of WSI\nimages.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the\nfailure of existing compressors is mainly due to information irregularity in\nWSI images. To resolve this issue, we developed a simple yet effective lossless\ncompressor called WISE, specifically designed for WSI images. WISE employs a\nhierarchical encoding strategy to extract effective bits, reducing the entropy\nof the image and then adopting a dictionary-based method to handle the\nirregular frequency patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show that WISE\ncan effectively compress the gigapixel WSI images to 36 times on average and up\nto 136 times.",

Over the past few years, significant progress has been made in image\nclassification due to the emergence of deep learning. However, challenges still\nexist, such as modeling fine-grained visual information, high computation\ncosts, the parallelism of the model, and inconsistent evaluation protocols\nacross datasets. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of existing\npapers on Vision Transformers for image classification. We first introduce the\npopular image classification datasets that influenced the design of models.\nThen, we present Vision Transformers models in chronological order, starting\nwith early attempts at adapting attention mechanism to vision tasks followed by\nthe adoption of vision transformers, as they have demonstrated success in\ncapturing intricate patterns and long-range dependencies within images.\nFinally, we discuss open problems and shed light on opportunities for image\nclassification to facilitate new research ideas.",

Through a series of controlled\nexperiments with models of 350M and 1.4B parameters, we demonstrate that the\nproposed cluster-based LLM scoring of diversity correlates positively with both\npre-training and supervised fine-tuning performance. Our findings also reveal\nthat synthetic data diversity in pre-training affects supervised fine-tuning\nmore significantly than pre-training itself, even for smaller models.

However, there is still a lack of\ndatasets to conduct large-scale evaluations of personalized IR; this is mainly\ndue to the fact that collecting and curating high-quality user-related\ninformation requires significant costs and time investment. Furthermore, the\ncreation of datasets for Personalized IR (PIR) tasks is affected by both\nprivacy concerns and the need for accurate user-related data, which are often\nnot publicly available. Recently, researchers have started to explore the use\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets, which is a\npossible solution to generate data for low-resource tasks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating\nsynthetic documents to train an IR system for a Personalized Community Question\nAnswering task. To study the effectiveness of IR models fine-tuned on\nLLM-generated data, we introduce a new dataset, named Sy-SE-PQA. We build\nSy-SE-PQA based on an existing dataset, SE-PQA, which consists of questions and\nanswers posted on the popular StackExchange communities. Starting from\nquestions in SE-PQA, we generate synthetic answers using different prompt\ntechniques and LLMs. Our findings suggest that LLMs have high potential in\ngenerating data tailored to users' needs.

For instance, an 8B\nmodel peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T.

Insufficient training\nsets could unexpectedly make the model overfit and fail to cope with complex\ntasks. Large language models (LLMs) trained on extensive corpora have prominent\ntext generation capabilities, which improve the quality and quantity of data\nand play a crucial role in data augmentation. Specifically, distinctive prompt\ntemplates are given in personalised tasks to guide LLMs in generating the\nrequired content. Recent promising retrieval-based techniques further improve\nthe expressive performance of LLMs in data augmentation by introducing external\nknowledge to enable them to produce more grounded-truth data. This survey\nprovides an in-depth analysis of data augmentation in LLMs, classifying the\ntechniques into Simple Augmentation, Prompt-based Augmentation, Retrieval-based\nAugmentation and Hybrid Augmentation. We summarise the post-processing\napproaches in data augmentation, which contributes significantly to refining\nthe augmented data and enabling the model to filter out unfaithful content.\nThen, we provide the common tasks and evaluation metrics. Finally, we introduce\nexisting challenges and future opportunities that could bring further\nimprovement to data augmentation.",

While prior works have\nfocused on developing effective data generation methods, they lack systematic\ncomparison of different LMs as data generators in a unified setting. To address\nthis gap, we propose AgoraBench, a benchmark that provides standardized\nsettings and metrics to evaluate LMs' data generation abilities. Through\nsynthesizing 1.26 million training instances using 6 LMs and training 99\nstudent models, we uncover key insights about LMs' data generation\ncapabilities. First, we observe that LMs exhibit distinct strengths. For\ninstance, GPT-4o excels at generating new problems, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet\nperforms better at enhancing existing ones. Furthermore, our analysis reveals\nthat an LM's data generation ability doesn't necessarily correlate with its\nproblem-solving ability. Instead, multiple intrinsic features of data\nquality-including response quality, perplexity, and instruction\ndifficulty-collectively serve as better indicators.

This paper surveys recent advances in using LLMs to create synthetic\ntext and code, emphasizing prompt-based generation, retrieval-augmented\npipelines, and iterative self-refinement. We show how these methods enrich\nlow-resource tasks such as classification and question answering, as well as\ncode-centric applications such as instruction tuning, code translation, and bug\nrepair, by enabling automated verification of functional correctness. Alongside\npotential benefits like cost-effectiveness, broad coverage, and controllable\ndiversity, we address challenges such as factual inaccuracies in generated\ntext, lack of stylistic realism, and the risk of bias amplification. Proposed\nmitigations include filtering and weighting outputs and reinforcement learning\nwith execution feedback for code. We conclude with open research directions\nlike automated prompt engineering, cross-modal data synthesis, and robust\nevaluation frameworks, highlighting the importance of LLM-generated synthetic\ndata in advancing AI while emphasizing ethical and quality safeguards.",

Quantization methods compress\ntheir size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized\nvalues of lower precision. Post-training quantization reduces model size\nefficiently at the cost of decreased accuracy, while quantization-aware\ntraining better preserves accuracy but is resource-intensive. Among existing\npost-training quantization algorithms, the ApiQ method achieves superior\naccuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two\nideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level.\nFirst, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques\nwith ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the\nbaseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads\nto two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is\ngained through full retraining may not be feasible through partial training.\n(2) This gain seems to depend on using a large and diverse dataset in\nquantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the\ntwo insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon\nApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. It\nrelies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the\nmost impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on benchmark\nlanguage models from the LLaMA family show that our proposed approach boosts\naccuracy and tightens the gap between the quantized model and the\nfull-precision model, with minimal overhead. Our method will be made publicly\navailable to facilitate future developments in ultra-low-bit quantization of\nlarge language models.",

Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is a popular\ntechnique, but it often faces challenges at low-bit levels, particularly in\ndownstream tasks. Quantization-aware Training (QAT) can alleviate this problem,\nbut it requires significantly more computational resources. To tackle this, we\nintroduced Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Quantization-Aware Training (DL-QAT),\nwhich merges the advantages of QAT while training only less than 1% of the\ntotal parameters. Specifically, we introduce a group-specific quantization\nmagnitude to adjust the overall scale of each quantization group. Within each\nquantization group, we use LoRA matrices to update the weight size and\ndirection in the quantization space. We validated the effectiveness of our\nmethod on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families. The results show significant\nimprovements over our baseline method across different quantization\ngranularities. For instance, for LLaMA-7B, our approach outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art method by 4.2% in MMLU on 3-bit LLaMA-7B model.\nAdditionally, our quantization results on pre-trained models also surpass\nprevious QAT methods, demonstrating the superior performance and efficiency of\nour approach.",

However, direct training of low-precision networks\ngenerally faces two obstacles: 1. The low-precision model exhibits limited\nrepresentation capabilities and cannot directly replicate full-precision\ncalculations, which constitutes a deficiency compared to full-precision\nalternatives; 2. Non-ideal deviations during gradient propagation are a common\nconsequence of employing pseudo-gradients as approximations in derived\nquantized functions. In this paper, we propose a general QAT framework for\nalleviating the aforementioned concerns by permitting the forward and backward\nprocesses of the low-precision network to be guided by the full-precision\npartner during training. In conjunction with the direct training of the\nquantization model, intermediate mixed-precision models are generated through\nthe block-by-block replacement on the full-precision model and working\nsimultaneously with the low-precision backbone, which enables the integration\nof quantized low-precision blocks into full-precision networks throughout the\ntraining phase. Consequently, each quantized block is capable of: 1. simulating\nfull-precision representation during forward passes; 2. obtaining gradients\nwith improved estimation during backward passes. We demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art results for 4-, 3-, and 2-bit\nquantization on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. The proposed framework provides a\ncompatible extension for most QAT methods and only requires a concise wrapper\nfor existing codes.",

Nevertheless, their practicality for real-world\napplications is constrained by substantial computational costs and latency\nissues. Quantization is a dominant way to compress and accelerate diffusion\nmodels, where post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training\n(QAT) are two main approaches, each bearing its own properties. While PTQ\nexhibits efficiency in terms of both time and data usage, it may lead to\ndiminished performance in low bit-width. On the other hand, QAT can alleviate\nperformance degradation but comes with substantial demands on computational and\ndata resources. In this paper, we introduce a data-free and parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning framework for low-bit diffusion models, dubbed EfficientDM, to\nachieve QAT-level performance with PTQ-like efficiency. Specifically, we\npropose a quantization-aware variant of the low-rank adapter (QALoRA) that can\nbe merged with model weights and jointly quantized to low bit-width. The\nfine-tuning process distills the denoising capabilities of the full-precision\nmodel into its quantized counterpart, eliminating the requirement for training\ndata. We also introduce scale-aware optimization and temporal learned step-size\nquantization to further enhance performance. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous PTQ-based\ndiffusion models while maintaining similar time and data efficiency.\nSpecifically, there is only a 0.05 sFID increase when quantizing both weights\nand activations of LDM-4 to 4-bit on ImageNet 256x256.

It learns quantized\nweights indirectly by updating latent weights,i.e., full-precision inputs to a\nquantizer, using gradient-based optimizers. We claim that coupling a\nuser-defined learning rate (LR) with these optimizers is sub-optimal for QAT.\nQuantized weights transit discrete levels of a quantizer, only if corresponding\nlatent weights pass transition points, where the quantizer changes discrete\nstates. This suggests that the changes of quantized weights are affected by\nboth the LR for latent weights and their distributions. It is thus difficult to\ncontrol the degree of changes for quantized weights by scheduling the LR\nmanually. We conjecture that the degree of parameter changes in QAT is related\nto the number of quantized weights transiting discrete levels. Based on this,\nwe introduce a transition rate (TR) scheduling technique that controls the\nnumber of transitions of quantized weights explicitly. Instead of scheduling a\nLR for latent weights, we schedule a target TR of quantized weights, and update\nthe latent weights with a novel transition-adaptive LR (TALR), enabling\nconsidering the degree of changes for the quantized weights during QAT.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard\nbenchmarks.",

However, direct training of low-precision networks\ngenerally faces two obstacles: 1. The low-precision model exhibits limited\nrepresentation capabilities and cannot directly replicate full-precision\ncalculations, which constitutes a deficiency compared to full-precision\nalternatives; 2. Non-ideal deviations during gradient propagation are a common\nconsequence of employing pseudo-gradients as approximations in derived\nquantized functions. In this paper, we propose a general QAT framework for\nalleviating the aforementioned concerns by permitting the forward and backward\nprocesses of the low-precision network to be guided by the full-precision\npartner during training. In conjunction with the direct training of the\nquantization model, intermediate mixed-precision models are generated through\nthe block-by-block replacement on the full-precision model and working\nsimultaneously with the low-precision backbone, which enables the integration\nof quantized low-precision blocks into full-precision networks throughout the\ntraining phase. Consequently, each quantized block is capable of: 1. simulating\nfull-precision representation during forward passes; 2. obtaining gradients\nwith improved estimation during backward passes. We demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art results for 4-, 3-, and 2-bit\nquantization on ImageNet and CIFAR-10.

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are omnipresent, however their practical\ndeployment is challenging due to their ever increasing computational and memory\ndemands. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more\ncompute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,\ngenerally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost\nof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it\nimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a\nlightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several\ncomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)\nlow-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a\ndowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)\ncheckpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,\nleading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen\nas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model\ncan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied\nacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices\nquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with\nmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families\nand validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method\noutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the\nsame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.\nSpecifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of\nmemory.

However, the\ncomputational demands of LLMs are immense, and the energy resources required to\nrun them are often limited. For instance, popular models like GPT-3, with 175\nbillion parameters and a storage requirement of 350 GB, present significant\nchallenges for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices and embedded\nsystems. These systems often lack the computational capacity to handle such\nlarge models. Quantization, a technique that reduces the precision of model\nvalues to a smaller set of discrete values, offers a promising solution by\nreducing the size of LLMs and accelerating inference. In this research, we\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of quantization techniques within the machine\nlearning field, with a particular focus on their application to LLMs. We begin\nby exploring the mathematical theory of quantization, followed by a review of\ncommon quantization methods and how they are implemented.

For instance, an 8B\nmodel peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T.

This,\nat scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance\nand robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for\nthe unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it\ngathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest\nprobability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most\nclosely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with\nstandard SFT training.\n  We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various\nsolutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune\ncommonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on\nGRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines,\nincluding distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to\n13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum\nperformance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to\nrealistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3\nand Olmo-2.

Through supervised\nfine-tuning, preference optimization, and self-improvement, SPEED enables small\nopen-source models to produce high-quality data. Remarkably, SPEED uses only\nless than 1/10 of the GPT API calls, outperforming the state-of-the-art\nembedding model E5_mistral when both are trained solely on their synthetic\ndata.

To meet our problem space\nrequirements, we fine-tune smaller LLMs to disaster domains, as these domains\ninvolve complex and low-frequency physical common sense knowledge. We introduce\na pipeline to create Field Ready Instruction Decoding Agent (FRIDA) models,\nwhere domain experts and linguists combine their knowledge to make high-quality\nseed data that is used to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning. We create a\nset of 130 seed instructions for synthetic generation, a synthetic dataset of\n25000 instructions, and 119 evaluation instructions relating to both general\nand earthquake-specific object affordances. We fine-tune several LLaMa and\nMistral instruction-tuned models and find that FRIDA models outperform their\nbase models at a variety of sizes. We then run an ablation study to understand\nwhich kinds of synthetic data most affect performance and find that training\nphysical state and object function common sense knowledge alone improves over\nFRIDA models trained on all data. We conclude that the FRIDA pipeline is\ncapable of instilling general common sense, but needs to be augmented with\ninformation retrieval for specific domain knowledge.",

The goal is to minimize the need\nfor costly domain-specific data for subsequent fine-tuning while achieving\ndesired performance levels. While many data selection algorithms have been\ndesigned for small-scale applications, rendering them unsuitable for our\ncontext, some emerging methods do cater to language data scales. However, they\noften prioritize data that aligns with the target distribution. While this\nstrategy may be effective when training a model from scratch, it can yield\nlimited results when the model has already been pre-trained on a different\ndistribution. Differing from prior work, our key idea is to select data that\nnudges the pre-training distribution closer to the target distribution. We show\nthe optimality of this approach for fine-tuning tasks under certain conditions.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology across a diverse array of tasks\n(NLU, NLG, zero-shot) with models up to 2.7B, showing that it consistently\nsurpasses other selection methods. Moreover, our proposed method is\nsignificantly faster than existing techniques, scaling to millions of samples\nwithin a single GPU hour. Our code is open-sourced (Code repository:\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/DV4LLM-D761/ ). While fine-tuning offers\nsignificant potential for enhancing performance across diverse tasks, its\nassociated costs often limit its widespread adoption; with this work, we hope\nto lay the groundwork for cost-effective fine-tuning, making its benefits more\naccessible.",

Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to\nunlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios.\nSeveral alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or\nhybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear,\nespecially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily\nverified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation\nstrategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation,\nQuestion Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs\ntrained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query\nbudget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across\nsettings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the\nratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed\ninstruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing\nquestions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new\nquestions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of\naugmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low\nto mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework\nfor selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into\naccount additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the\nimportance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for\nsynthetic data generation.",

However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy\nvisual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context\nlength cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant\nframes hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial.\nThis paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles:\nquery relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such\nas uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these\nprinciples. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with\ndynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and\nmodel-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nVideo-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the\nquery using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the\nsimilarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To\nincorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each\nsegment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov\ndecision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments.\nTheoretically, MDP3 provides a \\((1 - 1/e)\\)-approximate solution to the\nNP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time\ncomplexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly\noutperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.",

To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a\nSearch-Map-Search learning paradigm which combines the advantages of heuristic\nsearch and supervised learning to select the best combination of frames from a\nvideo as one entity. By combining search with learning, the proposed method can\nbetter capture frame interactions while incurring a low inference overhead.\nSpecifically, we first propose a hierarchical search method conducted on each\ntraining video to search for the optimal combination of frames with the lowest\nerror on the downstream task. A feature mapping function is then learned to map\nthe frames of a video to the representation of its target optimal frame\ncombination. During inference, another search is performed on an unseen video\nto select a combination of frames whose feature representation is close to the\nprojected feature representation.

However, when the visual input changes from a single\nimage to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the\nvast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of\nMLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon\nsampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key\ninformation to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers. This paper presents\na simple yet effective algorithm named Adaptive Keyframe Sampling (AKS). It\ninserts a plug-and-play module known as keyframe selection, which aims to\nmaximize the useful information with a fixed number of video tokens. We\nformulate keyframe selection as an optimization involving (1) the relevance\nbetween the keyframes and the prompt, and (2) the coverage of the keyframes\nover the video, and present an adaptive algorithm to approximate the best\nsolution. Experiments on two long video understanding benchmarks validate that\nAdaptive Keyframe Sampling improves video QA accuracy (beyond strong baselines)\nupon selecting informative keyframes. Our study reveals the importance of\ninformation pre-filtering in video-based MLLMs. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ncTimTang/AKS.",

Frame selection aims to extract the most informative\nand representative frames to help a model better understand video content.\nExisting frame selection methods either individually sample frames based on\nper-frame importance prediction, without considering interaction among frames,\nor adopt reinforcement learning agents to find representative frames in\nsuccession, which are costly to train and may lead to potential stability\nissues. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a\nSearch-Map-Search learning paradigm which combines the advantages of heuristic\nsearch and supervised learning to select the best combination of frames from a\nvideo as one entity. By combining search with learning, the proposed method can\nbetter capture frame interactions while incurring a low inference overhead.\nSpecifically, we first propose a hierarchical search method conducted on each\ntraining video to search for the optimal combination of frames with the lowest\nerror on the downstream task. A feature mapping function is then learned to map\nthe frames of a video to the representation of its target optimal frame\ncombination. During inference, another search is performed on an unseen video\nto select a combination of frames whose feature representation is close to the\nprojected feature representation. Extensive experiments based on several action\nrecognition benchmarks demonstrate that our frame selection method effectively\nimproves performance of action recognition models, and significantly\noutperforms a number of competitive baselines.",

To train\nFrame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by\nranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM.

However, processing multiple frames leads to lengthy\nvisual token sequences, presenting challenges such as the limited context\nlength cannot accommodate the entire video, and the inclusion of irrelevant\nframes hinders visual perception. Hence, effective frame selection is crucial.\nThis paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles:\nquery relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality. Existing methods, such\nas uniform frame sampling and query-frame matching, do not capture all of these\nprinciples. Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with\ndynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and\nmodel-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nVideo-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the\nquery using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the\nsimilarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To\nincorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each\nsegment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov\ndecision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments.\nTheoretically, MDP3 provides a \\((1 - 1/e)\\)-approximate solution to the\nNP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time\ncomplexity, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, MDP3 significantly\noutperforms existing methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.",

In this work, we propose geometric trajectory diffusion models\n(GeoTDM), the first diffusion model for modeling the temporal distribution of\n3D geometric trajectories. Modeling such distribution is challenging as it\nrequires capturing both the complex spatial interactions with physical\nsymmetries and temporal correspondence encapsulated in the dynamics. We\ntheoretically justify that diffusion models with equivariant temporal kernels\ncan lead to density with desired symmetry, and develop a novel transition\nkernel leveraging SE(3)-equivariant spatial convolution and temporal attention.\nFurthermore, to induce an expressive trajectory distribution for conditional\ngeneration, we introduce a generalized learnable geometric prior into the\nforward diffusion process to enhance temporal conditioning. We conduct\nextensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation in\nvarious scenarios, including physical simulation, molecular dynamics, and\npedestrian motion.

Leveraging reflow techniques, ProtFlow enables high-quality\nsingle-step sequence generation. Additionally, we develop a joint design\npipeline for the design scene of multichain proteins. We evaluate ProtFlow\nacross diverse protein design tasks, including general peptides and long-chain\nproteins, antimicrobial peptides, and antibodies. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ProtFlow outperforms task-specific methods in these\napplications, underscoring its potential and broad applicability in\ncomputational protein sequence design and analysis.",

A dominant paradigm is to\ntrain a model to jointly generate the antibody sequence and the structure as a\ncandidate. However, the joint generation requires the model to generate both\nthe discrete amino acid categories and the continuous 3D coordinates; this\nlimits the space of possible architectures and may lead to suboptimal\nperformance. In response, we propose an antibody sequence-structure decoupling\n(ASSD) framework, which separates sequence generation and structure prediction.\nAlthough our approach is simple, our idea allows the use of powerful neural\narchitectures and demonstrates notable performance improvements. We also find\nthat the widely used non-autoregressive generators promote sequences with\noverly repeating tokens. Such sequences are both out-of-distribution and prone\nto undesirable developability properties that can trigger harmful immune\nresponses in patients. To resolve this, we introduce a composition-based\nobjective that allows an efficient trade-off between high performance and low\ntoken repetition. ASSD shows improved performance in various antibody design\nexperiments, while the composition-based objective successfully mitigates token\nrepetition of non-autoregressive models.",

Functional Encryption enables data owners to\ngrant third-party access to perform specified computations without disclosing\ntheir inputs. It also provides computation results in plain, unlike Fully\nHomomorphic Encryption. The ubiquitousness of machine learning has led to the\ncollection of massive private data in the cloud computing environment. This\nraises potential privacy issues and the need for more private and secure\ncomputing solutions. Numerous efforts have been made in privacy-preserving\nmachine learning (PPML) to address security and privacy concerns. There are\napproaches based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), secure multiparty\ncomputation (SMC), and, more recently, functional encryption (FE). However,\nFE-based PPML is still in its infancy and has not yet gotten much attention\ncompared to FHE-based PPML approaches. In this paper, we provide a\nsystematization of PPML works based on FE summarizing state-of-the-art in the\nliterature. We focus on Inner-product-FE and Quadratic-FE-based machine\nlearning models for the PPML applications. We analyze the performance and\nusability of the available FE libraries and their applications to PPML. We also\ndiscuss potential directions for FE-based PPML approaches. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to systematize FE-based PPML approaches.",

Prioritization of privacy can limit\nthe effectiveness of these interactions, as achieving certain goals\nnecessitates sharing private data. Traditionally, addressing this challenge has\ninvolved either seeking trusted intermediaries or constructing cryptographic\nprotocols that restrict how much data is revealed, such as multi-party\ncomputations or zero-knowledge proofs. While significant advances have been\nmade in scaling cryptographic approaches, they remain limited in terms of the\nsize and complexity of applications they can be used for. In this paper, we\nargue that capable machine learning models can fulfill the role of a trusted\nthird party, thus enabling secure computations for applications that were\npreviously infeasible. In particular, we describe Trusted Capable Model\nEnvironments (TCMEs) as an alternative approach for scaling secure computation,\nwhere capable machine learning model(s) interact under input/output\nconstraints, with explicit information flow control and explicit statelessness.\nThis approach aims to achieve a balance between privacy and computational\nefficiency, enabling private inference where classical cryptographic solutions\nare currently infeasible. We describe a number of use cases that are enabled by\nTCME, and show that even some simple classic cryptographic problems can already\nbe solved with TCME.

One such approach is the use of Homomorphic\nEncryption (HE). However, the significant drawbacks and inefficiencies of\ntraditional HE render it impractical for highly scalable scenarios.\nFortunately, a modern cryptographic scheme, Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption\n(HHE), has recently emerged, combining the strengths of symmetric cryptography\nand HE to surmount these challenges. Our work seeks to introduce HHE to ML by\ndesigning a PPML scheme tailored for end devices. We leverage HHE as the\nfundamental building block to enable secure learning of classification outcomes\nover encrypted data, all while preserving the privacy of the input data and ML\nmodel. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our construction by\ndeveloping and evaluating an HHE-based PPML application for classifying heart\ndisease based on sensitive ECG data. Notably, our evaluations revealed a slight\nreduction in accuracy compared to inference on plaintext data. Additionally,\nboth the analyst and end devices experience minimal communication and\ncomputation costs, underscoring the practical viability of our approach.

            "abstract": "The adoption of machine learning solutions is rapidly increasing across all\nparts of society. As the models grow larger, both training and inference of\nmachine learning models is increasingly outsourced, e.g. to cloud service\nproviders. This means that potentially sensitive data is processed on untrusted\nplatforms, which bears inherent data security and privacy risks. In this work,\nwe investigate how to protect distributed machine learning systems, focusing on\ndeep convolutional neural networks. The most common and best-performing mixed\nMPC approaches are based on HE, secret sharing, and garbled circuits. They\ncommonly suffer from large performance overheads, big accuracy losses, and\ncommunication overheads that grow linearly in the depth of the neural network.\nTo improve on these problems, we present Dash, a fast and distributed private\nconvolutional neural network inference scheme secure against malicious\nattackers. Building on arithmetic garbling gadgets [BMR16] and fancy-garbling\n[BCM+19], Dash is based purely on arithmetic garbled circuits. We introduce\nLabelTensors that allow us to leverage the massive parallelity of modern GPUs.\nCombined with state-of-the-art garbling optimizations, Dash outperforms\nprevious garbling approaches up to a factor of about 100. Furthermore, we\nintroduce an efficient scaling operation over the residues of the Chinese\nremainder theorem representation to arithmetic garbled circuits, which allows\nus to garble larger networks and achieve much higher accuracy than previous\napproaches. Finally, Dash requires only a single communication round per\ninference step, regardless of the depth of the neural network, and a very small\nconstant online communication volume.",

However, the approaches and methods in doing so vary vastly between\nthe two fields. In this paper, we explore integrating the knowledge from the ML\ndomain to provide empirical evaluations of cryptosystems. Particularly, we\nutilize information theoretic metrics to perform ML-based distribution\nestimation. We propose two novel applications of ML algorithms that can be\napplied in a known plaintext setting to perform cryptanalysis on any\ncryptosystem. We use mutual information neural estimation to calculate a\ncryptosystem's mutual information leakage, and a binary cross entropy\nclassification to model an indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack\n(CPA). These algorithms can be readily applied in an audit setting to evaluate\nthe robustness of a cryptosystem and the results can provide a useful empirical\nbound. We evaluate the efficacy of our methodologies by empirically analyzing\nseveral encryption schemes. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to novel\nnetwork coding-based cryptosystems and provide other use cases for our\nalgorithms. We show that our classification model correctly identifies the\nencryption schemes that are not IND-CPA secure, such as DES, RSA, and AES ECB,\nwith high accuracy. It also identifies the faults in CPA-secure cryptosystems\nwith faulty parameters, such a reduced counter version of AES-CTR. We also\nconclude that with our algorithms, in most cases a smaller-sized neural network\nusing less computing power can identify vulnerabilities in cryptosystems,\nproviding a quick check of the sanity of the cryptosystem and help to decide\nwhether to spend more resources to deploy larger networks that are able to\nbreak the cryptosystem.",

Numerous efforts have been made in privacy-preserving\nmachine learning (PPML) to address security and privacy concerns.

Most existing\nmethods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting\nintricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control\nprecision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts,\nthus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts.\nSpecifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle\nstatic and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change\nproperty to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables,\nenabling independent control over motion and identity. To establish the\ntheoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the\nidentifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we\ndesign a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce\nthe minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the\ndimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional\nindependence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in\nfor GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video\ngeneration benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves\ngeneration quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.",

This allows flexible manipulation of each modality's\nrole, enabling support for a wide range of tasks.

However, by taking only\nnatural languages as input, users often face difficulties in providing detailed\ninformation to precisely control the model's output. In this work, we propose\nfine-grained controllable video generation (FACTOR) to achieve detailed\ncontrol. Specifically, FACTOR aims to control objects' appearances and context,\nincluding their location and category, in conjunction with the text prompt. To\nachieve detailed control, we propose a unified framework to jointly inject\ncontrol signals into the existing text-to-video model. Our model consists of a\njoint encoder and adaptive cross-attention layers. By optimizing the encoder\nand the inserted layer, we adapt the model to generate videos that are aligned\nwith both text prompts and fine-grained control. Compared to existing methods\nrelying on dense control signals such as edge maps, we provide a more intuitive\nand user-friendly interface to allow object-level fine-grained control. Our\nmethod achieves controllability of object appearances without finetuning, which\nreduces the per-subject optimization efforts for the users. Extensive\nexperiments on standard benchmark datasets and user-provided inputs validate\nthat our model obtains a 70% improvement in controllability metrics over\ncompetitive baselines.",

Researchers began\nto increasingly recognize the importance of physical fidelity in video\ngeneration and attempted to integrate heuristic physical cognition such as\nmotion representations and physical knowledge into generative systems to\nsimulate real-world dynamic scenarios. Considering the lack of a systematic\noverview in this field, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive summary of\narchitecture designs and their applications to fill this gap. Specifically, we\ndiscuss and organize the evolutionary process of physical cognition in video\ngeneration from a cognitive science perspective, while proposing a three-tier\ntaxonomy: 1) basic schema perception for generation, 2) passive cognition of\nphysical knowledge for generation, and 3) active cognition for world\nsimulation, encompassing state-of-the-art methods, classical paradigms, and\nbenchmarks. Subsequently, we emphasize the inherent key challenges in this\ndomain and delineate potential pathways for future research, contributing to\nadvancing the frontiers of discussion in both academia and industry. Through\nstructured review and interdisciplinary analysis, this survey aims to provide\ndirectional guidance for developing interpretable, controllable, and physically\nconsistent video generation paradigms, thereby propelling generative models\nfrom the stage of ''visual mimicry'' towards a new phase of ''human-like\nphysical comprehension''.",

Among various methods, recent\nworks have found that simply manipulating attention modules by concatenating\nfeatures from multiple reference images provides an efficient approach to\nenhancing consistency without fine-tuning. Despite its popularity and success,\nfew studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its\neffectiveness. In this work, we reveal that the popular approach is a linear\ninterpolation of image self-attention and cross-attention between synthesized\ncontent and reference features, with a constant rank-1 coefficient. Motivated\nby this observation, we find that a rank-1 coefficient is not necessary and\nsimplifies the controllable generation mechanism. The resulting algorithm,\nwhich we coin as RefDrop, allows users to control the influence of reference\ncontext in a direct and precise manner. Besides further enhancing consistency\nin single-subject image generation, our method also enables more interesting\napplications, such as the consistent generation of multiple subjects,\nsuppressing specific features to encourage more diverse content, and\nhigh-quality personalized video generation by boosting temporal consistency.\nEven compared with state-of-the-art image-prompt-based generators, such as\nIP-Adapter, RefDrop is competitive in terms of controllability and quality\nwhile avoiding the need to train a separate image encoder for feature injection\nfrom reference images, making it a versatile plug-and-play solution for any\nimage or video diffusion model.",

Despite this, their\ndeficiencies in physical cognition have gradually received widespread attention\n- generated content often violates the fundamental laws of physics, falling\ninto the dilemma of ''visual realism but physical absurdity\". Researchers began\nto increasingly recognize the importance of physical fidelity in video\ngeneration and attempted to integrate heuristic physical cognition such as\nmotion representations and physical knowledge into generative systems to\nsimulate real-world dynamic scenarios. Considering the lack of a systematic\noverview in this field, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive summary of\narchitecture designs and their applications to fill this gap. Specifically, we\ndiscuss and organize the evolutionary process of physical cognition in video\ngeneration from a cognitive science perspective, while proposing a three-tier\ntaxonomy: 1) basic schema perception for generation, 2) passive cognition of\nphysical knowledge for generation, and 3) active cognition for world\nsimulation, encompassing state-of-the-art methods, classical paradigms, and\nbenchmarks. Subsequently, we emphasize the inherent key challenges in this\ndomain and delineate potential pathways for future research, contributing to\nadvancing the frontiers of discussion in both academia and industry. Through\nstructured review and interdisciplinary analysis, this survey aims to provide\ndirectional guidance for developing interpretable, controllable, and physically\nconsistent video generation paradigms, thereby propelling generative models\nfrom the stage of ''visual mimicry'' towards a new phase of ''human-like\nphysical comprehension''.",

Most existing\nmethods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting\nintricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control\nprecision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts,\nthus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts.\nSpecifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle\nstatic and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change\nproperty to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables,\nenabling independent control over motion and identity. To establish the\ntheoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the\nidentifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we\ndesign a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce\nthe minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the\ndimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional\nindependence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in\nfor GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video\ngeneration benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves\ngeneration quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.",

However, existing approaches are limited to\nsimplified, toy settings and lack generalizability to complex, real-world\nenvironments. Recent advances in generative models have enabled the prediction\nof state transitions based on interventions, but focus on generating a single\nfuture state which neglects the continuous dynamics resulting from the\ninteraction. To address this gap, we propose InterDyn, a novel framework that\ngenerates videos of interactive dynamics given an initial frame and a control\nsignal encoding the motion of a driving object or actor. Our key insight is\nthat large video generation models can act as both neural renderers and\nimplicit physics ``simulators'', having learned interactive dynamics from\nlarge-scale video data. To effectively harness this capability, we introduce an\ninteractive control mechanism that conditions the video generation process on\nthe motion of the driving entity. Qualitative results demonstrate that InterDyn\ngenerates plausible, temporally consistent videos of complex object\ninteractions while generalizing to unseen objects. Quantitative evaluations\nshow that InterDyn outperforms baselines that focus on static state\ntransitions. This work highlights the potential of leveraging video generative\nmodels as implicit physics engines. Project page:\nhttps://interdyn.is.tue.mpg.de/",

Among various methods, recent\nworks have found that simply manipulating attention modules by concatenating\nfeatures from multiple reference images provides an efficient approach to\nenhancing consistency without fine-tuning. Despite its popularity and success,\nfew studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its\neffectiveness. In this work, we reveal that the popular approach is a linear\ninterpolation of image self-attention and cross-attention between synthesized\ncontent and reference features, with a constant rank-1 coefficient. Motivated\nby this observation, we find that a rank-1 coefficient is not necessary and\nsimplifies the controllable generation mechanism. The resulting algorithm,\nwhich we coin as RefDrop, allows users to control the influence of reference\ncontext in a direct and precise manner. Besides further enhancing consistency\nin single-subject image generation, our method also enables more interesting\napplications, such as the consistent generation of multiple subjects,\nsuppressing specific features to encourage more diverse content, and\nhigh-quality personalized video generation by boosting temporal consistency.\nEven compared with state-of-the-art image-prompt-based generators, such as\nIP-Adapter, RefDrop is competitive in terms of controllability and quality\nwhile avoiding the need to train a separate image encoder for feature injection\nfrom reference images, making it a versatile plug-and-play solution for any\nimage or video diffusion model.",

Our research is a step towards adding hardware fault tolerance and\nfast fault adaptability to machines. In this research, our primary focus is to\ninvestigate the efficacy of generative flow networks in robotic environments,\nparticularly in the domain of machine fault adaptation. We simulated a robotic\nenvironment called Reacher in our experiments. We modify this environment to\nintroduce four distinct fault environments that replicate real-world\nmachines/robot malfunctions. The empirical evaluation of this research\nindicates that continuous generative flow networks (CFlowNets) indeed have the\ncapability to add adaptive behaviors in machines under adversarial conditions.\nFurthermore, the comparative analysis of CFlowNets with reinforcement learning\nalgorithms also provides some key insights into the performance in terms of\nadaptation speed and sample efficiency.

To address this, we\npropose STAR (Smart Task Adaptation and Recovery), a novel framework that\nsynergizes Foundation Models (FMs) with dynamically expanding Knowledge Graphs\n(KGs) to enable resilient task planning and autonomous failure recovery. While\nFMs offer remarkable generalization and contextual reasoning, their\nlimitations, including computational inefficiency, hallucinations, and output\ninconsistencies hinder reliable deployment. STAR mitigates these issues by\nembedding learned knowledge into structured, reusable KGs, which streamline\ninformation retrieval, reduce redundant FM computations, and provide precise,\nscenario-specific insights. The framework leverages FM-driven reasoning to\ndiagnose failures, generate context-aware recovery strategies, and execute\ncorrective actions without human intervention or system restarts. Unlike\nconventional approaches that rely on rigid protocols, STAR dynamically expands\nits KG with experiential knowledge, ensuring continuous adaptation to novel\nscenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we developed a\ncomprehensive dataset that includes various robotic tasks and failure\nscenarios. Through extensive experimentation, STAR demonstrated an 86% task\nplanning accuracy and 78% recovery success rate, showing significant\nimprovements over baseline methods.

Since the\nadvent of large vision and language models (VLMs), robots are now also capable\nof higher-level semantic scene understanding and natural language interactions\nwith humans. Despite their known vulnerabilities (e.g. hallucinations or\njail-breaking), VLMs are being handed control of robots capable of physical\ncontact with the real world. This can lead to dangerous behaviors, making\nsemantic safety for robots a matter of immediate concern. Our contributions in\nthis paper are two fold: first, to address these emerging risks, we release the\nASIMOV Benchmark, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of datasets for\nevaluating and improving semantic safety of foundation models serving as robot\nbrains. Our data generation recipe is highly scalable: by leveraging text and\nimage generation techniques, we generate undesirable situations from real-world\nvisual scenes and human injury reports from hospitals. Secondly, we develop a\nframework to automatically generate robot constitutions from real-world data to\nsteer a robot's behavior using Constitutional AI mechanisms. We propose a novel\nauto-amending process that is able to introduce nuances in written rules of\nbehavior; this can lead to increased alignment with human preferences on\nbehavior desirability and safety. We explore trade-offs between generality and\nspecificity across a diverse set of constitutions of different lengths, and\ndemonstrate that a robot is able to effectively reject unconstitutional\nactions. We measure a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using\ngenerated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and\nhuman-written constitutions.

To address this, we\npropose STAR (Smart Task Adaptation and Recovery), a novel framework that\nsynergizes Foundation Models (FMs) with dynamically expanding Knowledge Graphs\n(KGs) to enable resilient task planning and autonomous failure recovery. While\nFMs offer remarkable generalization and contextual reasoning, their\nlimitations, including computational inefficiency, hallucinations, and output\ninconsistencies hinder reliable deployment. STAR mitigates these issues by\nembedding learned knowledge into structured, reusable KGs, which streamline\ninformation retrieval, reduce redundant FM computations, and provide precise,\nscenario-specific insights. The framework leverages FM-driven reasoning to\ndiagnose failures, generate context-aware recovery strategies, and execute\ncorrective actions without human intervention or system restarts. Unlike\nconventional approaches that rely on rigid protocols, STAR dynamically expands\nits KG with experiential knowledge, ensuring continuous adaptation to novel\nscenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we developed a\ncomprehensive dataset that includes various robotic tasks and failure\nscenarios. Through extensive experimentation, STAR demonstrated an 86% task\nplanning accuracy and 78% recovery success rate, showing significant\nimprovements over baseline methods.

            "abstract": "Data scaling and standardized evaluation benchmarks have driven significant\nadvances in natural language processing and computer vision. However, robotics\nfaces unique challenges in scaling data and establishing evaluation protocols.\nCollecting real-world data is resource-intensive and inefficient, while\nbenchmarking in real-world scenarios remains highly complex. Synthetic data and\nsimulation offer promising alternatives, yet existing efforts often fall short\nin data quality, diversity, and benchmark standardization. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce RoboVerse, a comprehensive framework comprising a\nsimulation platform, a synthetic dataset, and unified benchmarks. Our\nsimulation platform supports multiple simulators and robotic embodiments,\nenabling seamless transitions between different environments. The synthetic\ndataset, featuring high-fidelity physics and photorealistic rendering, is\nconstructed through multiple approaches. Additionally, we propose unified\nbenchmarks for imitation learning and reinforcement learning, enabling\nevaluation across different levels of generalization. At the core of the\nsimulation platform is MetaSim, an infrastructure that abstracts diverse\nsimulation environments into a universal interface. It restructures existing\nsimulation environments into a simulator-agnostic configuration system, as well\nas an API aligning different simulator functionalities, such as launching\nsimulation environments, loading assets with initial states, stepping the\nphysics engine, etc. This abstraction ensures interoperability and\nextensibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RoboVerse enhances\nthe performance of imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world model\nlearning, and sim-to-real transfer. These results validate the reliability of\nour dataset and benchmarks, establishing RoboVerse as a robust solution for\nadvancing robot learning.",

At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language\nmodels (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that\ninteract with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how\nperformant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform\nwork-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for\nboth industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy\nto understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To\nmeasure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world\nprofessional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible\nbenchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways\nto those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running\nprograms, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained\nenvironment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software\ncompany environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by\nworkers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed\nAPI-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most\ncompetitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints\na nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating\na real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously,\nbut more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current\nsystems.",

We take a firm position: traditional\nbenchmarks are insufficient to ensure the reliability of LLM agents in finance.\nTo address this, we analyze existing financial LLM agent benchmarks, finding\nsafety gaps and introducing ten risk-aware evaluation metrics. Through an\nempirical evaluation of both API-based and open-weight LLM agents, we reveal\nhidden vulnerabilities that remain undetected by conventional assessments. To\nmove the field forward, we propose the Safety-Aware Evaluation Agent (SAEA),\ngrounded in a three-level evaluation framework that assesses agents at the\nmodel level (intrinsic capabilities), workflow level (multi-step process\nreliability), and system level (integration robustness). Our findings highlight\nthe urgent need to redefine LLM agent evaluation standards by shifting the\nfocus from raw performance to safety, robustness, and real world resilience.",

In this paper, we introduce FinBen, the first extensive open-source\nevaluation benchmark, including 36 datasets spanning 24 financial tasks,\ncovering seven critical aspects: information extraction (IE), textual analysis,\nquestion answering (QA), text generation, risk management, forecasting, and\ndecision-making. FinBen offers several key innovations: a broader range of\ntasks and datasets, the first evaluation of stock trading, novel agent and\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation, and three novel open-source\nevaluation datasets for text summarization, question answering, and stock\ntrading. Our evaluation of 15 representative LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT,\nand the latest Gemini, reveals several key findings: While LLMs excel in IE and\ntextual analysis, they struggle with advanced reasoning and complex tasks like\ntext generation and forecasting. GPT-4 excels in IE and stock trading, while\nGemini is better at text generation and forecasting. Instruction-tuned LLMs\nimprove textual analysis but offer limited benefits for complex tasks such as\nQA. FinBen has been used to host the first financial LLMs shared task at the\nFinNLP-AgentScen workshop during IJCAI-2024, attracting 12 teams. Their novel\nsolutions outperformed GPT-4, showcasing FinBen's potential to drive innovation\nin financial LLMs. All datasets, results, and codes are released for the\nresearch community: https://github.com/The-FinAI/PIXIU.",

The open-source\nframework incorporates a persistent order book with market and limit orders,\npartial fills, dividends, and equilibrium clearing alongside agents with varied\nstrategies, information sets, and endowments. Agents submit standardized\ndecisions using structured outputs and function calls while expressing their\nreasoning in natural language. Three findings emerge: First, LLMs demonstrate\nconsistent strategy adherence and can function as value investors, momentum\ntraders, or market makers per their instructions. Second, market dynamics\nexhibit features of real financial markets, including price discovery, bubbles,\nunderreaction, and strategic liquidity provision. Third, the framework enables\nanalysis of LLMs' responses to varying market conditions, similar to partial\ndependence plots in machine-learning interpretability. The framework allows\nsimulating financial theories without closed-form solutions, creating\nexperimental designs that would be costly with human participants, and\nestablishing how prompts can generate correlated behaviors affecting market\nstability.",

The primary objective is to assess how LLMs can\nreplicate a systematic review on a corpus of ESG-focused papers. We compiled\nand hand-coded a database of 88 relevant papers published from March 2020 to\nMay 2024. Additionally, we used a set of 238 papers from a previous systematic\nreview of ESG literature from January 2015 to February 2020. We evaluated two\ncurrent state-of-the-art LLMs, Meta AI's Llama 3 8B and OpenAI's GPT-4o, on the\naccuracy of their interpretations relative to human-made classifications on\nboth sets of papers. We then compared these results to a \"Custom GPT\" and a\nfine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model using the corpus of 238 papers as training data.\nThe fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model outperformed the base LLMs by 28.3% on average\nin overall accuracy on prompt 1. At the same time, the \"Custom GPT\" showed a\n3.0% and 15.7% improvement on average in overall accuracy on prompts 2 and 3,\nrespectively. Our findings reveal promising results for investors and agencies\nto leverage LLMs to summarize complex evidence related to ESG investing,\nthereby enabling quicker decision-making and a more efficient market.",

The answer to this question has important implications for\nboth industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy\nto understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To\nmeasure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world\nprofessional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible\nbenchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways\nto those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running\nprograms, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained\nenvironment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software\ncompany environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by\nworkers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed\nAPI-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most\ncompetitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints\na nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating\na real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously,\nbut more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current\nsystems.",

The\nrapid integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), offers opportunities to enhance the equity rating\nprocess. This paper explores the application of LLMs to generate multi-horizon\nstock ratings by ingesting diverse datasets. Traditional stock rating methods\nrely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several\nchallenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed\nreactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs\nto improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings. Additionally, we\nassess the efficacy of using different data modalities with LLMs for the\nfinancial domain.\n  We utilize varied datasets comprising fundamental financial, market, and news\ndata from January 2022 to June 2024, along with GPT-4-32k (v0613) (with a\ntraining cutoff in Sep. 2021 to prevent information leakage). Our results show\nthat our benchmark method outperforms traditional stock rating methods when\nassessed by forward returns, specially when incorporating financial\nfundamentals. While integrating news data improves short-term performance,\nsubstituting detailed news summaries with sentiment scores reduces token use\nwithout loss of performance. In many cases, omitting news data entirely\nenhances performance by reducing bias.\n  Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large\namounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at\nthe stock rating prediction task. Our work provides a reproducible and\nefficient framework for generating accurate stock ratings, serving as a\ncost-effective alternative to traditional methods.

We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from\nJanuary 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs,\nincluding BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary\nmodel, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The\nstudy documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent\ndaily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the\nhighest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly\nahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald\ndictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1%\naccuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model\nscores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in\ndifferent model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive\nrelevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant\nrelationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock\nreturns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current\nfinancial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels\nwith a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT\nlong-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary\nyield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior\nperformance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction\nand portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of\nfinancial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy\nanalysis.",

In this study,\nwe assess the breadth of LLMs' knowledge using financial data of U.S. publicly\ntraded companies by evaluating more than 197k questions and comparing model\nresponses to factual data. We further explore the impact of company\ncharacteristics, such as size, retail investment, institutional attention, and\nreadability of financial filings, on the accuracy of knowledge represented in\nLLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs are less informed about past financial\nperformance, but they display a stronger awareness of larger companies and more\nrecent information. Interestingly, at the same time, our analysis also reveals\nthat LLMs are more likely to hallucinate for larger companies, especially for\ndata from more recent years.

Our framework directs the LLMs to create background\nknowledge through a fill-in-the-blank strategy and then discerns potential\nfactors affecting stock prices from related news. Guided by background\nknowledge and identified factors, we leverage historical stock prices in\ntextual format to predict stock movement.

One of the most popular research areas involves\napplying these agents to video games. Traditionally, these methods have relied\non game APIs to access in-game environmental and action data. However, this\napproach is limited by the availability of APIs and does not reflect how humans\nplay games. With the advent of vision language models (VLMs), agents now have\nenhanced visual understanding capabilities, enabling them to interact with\ngames using only visual inputs. Despite these advances, current approaches\nstill face challenges in action-oriented tasks, particularly in action\nrole-playing games (ARPGs), where reinforcement learning methods are prevalent\nbut suffer from poor generalization and require extensive training. To address\nthese limitations, we select an ARPG, ``Black Myth: Wukong'', as a research\nplatform to explore the capability boundaries of existing VLMs in scenarios\nrequiring visual-only input and complex action output. We define 12 tasks\nwithin the game, with 75% focusing on combat, and incorporate several\nstate-of-the-art VLMs into this benchmark. Additionally, we will release a\nhuman operation dataset containing recorded gameplay videos and operation logs,\nincluding mouse and keyboard actions. Moreover, we propose a novel VARP (Vision\nAction Role-Playing) agent framework, consisting of an action planning system\nand a visual trajectory system. Our framework demonstrates the ability to\nperform basic tasks and succeed in 90% of easy and medium-level combat\nscenarios. This research aims to provide new insights and directions for\napplying multimodal agents in complex action game environments. The code and\ndatasets will be made available at https://varp-agent.github.io/.",

Concurrently, there is an emerging research trend\nfocused on extending these LLM-powered AI agents into the multimodal domain.\nThis extension enables AI agents to interpret and respond to diverse multimodal\nuser queries, thereby handling more intricate and nuanced tasks. In this paper,\nwe conduct a systematic review of LLM-driven multimodal agents, which we refer\nto as large multimodal agents ( LMAs for short). First, we introduce the\nessential components involved in developing LMAs and categorize the current\nbody of research into four distinct types. Subsequently, we review the\ncollaborative frameworks integrating multiple LMAs , enhancing collective\nefficacy. One of the critical challenges in this field is the diverse\nevaluation methods used across existing studies, hindering effective comparison\namong different LMAs . Therefore, we compile these evaluation methodologies and\nestablish a comprehensive framework to bridge the gaps. This framework aims to\nstandardize evaluations, facilitating more meaningful comparisons. Concluding\nour review, we highlight the extensive applications of LMAs and propose\npossible future research directions. Our discussion aims to provide valuable\ninsights and guidelines for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

            "abstract": "For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent\nto or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle\nfor this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their\nenvironment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to\ndevelop intelligent agents, but they mainly focus on advancement in algorithms\nor training strategies to enhance specific capabilities or performance on\nparticular tasks. Actually, what the community lacks is a general and powerful\nmodel to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to\ndiverse scenarios. Due to the versatile capabilities they demonstrate, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents. Many\nresearchers have leveraged LLMs as the foundation to build AI agents and have\nachieved significant progress. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive survey\non LLM-based agents. We start by tracing the concept of agents from its\nphilosophical origins to its development in AI, and explain why LLMs are\nsuitable foundations for agents. Building upon this, we present a general\nframework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components: brain,\nperception, and action, and the framework can be tailored for different\napplications. Subsequently, we explore the extensive applications of LLM-based\nagents in three aspects: single-agent scenarios, multi-agent scenarios, and\nhuman-agent cooperation. Following this, we delve into agent societies,\nexploring the behavior and personality of LLM-based agents, the social\nphenomena that emerge from an agent society, and the insights they offer for\nhuman society.
