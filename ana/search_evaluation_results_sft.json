However,\nthe effectiveness of LLM backbones in this domain remains a topic of debate.\nBased on thorough empirical analyses, we observe that training and testing\nLLM-based models on small datasets often leads to the Encoder and Decoder\nbecoming overly adapted to the dataset, thereby obscuring the true predictive\ncapabilities of the LLM backbone. To investigate the genuine potential of LLMs\nin time series prediction, we introduce three pre-training models with\nidentical architectures but different pre-training strategies. Thereby,\nlarge-scale pre-training allows us to create unbiased Encoder and Decoder\ncomponents tailored to the LLM backbone. Through controlled experiments, we\nevaluate the zero-shot and few-shot prediction performance of the LLM, offering\ninsights into its capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal that although the\nLLM backbone demonstrates some promise, its forecasting performance is limited.\nOur source code is publicly available in the anonymous repository:\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM4TS-0B5C.",

However, we observe that in\nstandard decoder-style LLMs, attention matrices degenerate to single-column for\ndeeper layers. Layers in this state are unable to learn anything meaningful and\nmostly redundant; we refer to these as lazy layers. The goal of this paper is\nto train smaller models by eliminating this structural inefficiency without\ncompromising performance.\n  Motivated by this observation, we propose Inheritune, a simple yet effective\ntraining recipe for developing smaller, high-performing language models.\nSmaller models trained with Inheritune, inherit early transformer layers from a\nlarger pre-trained model, then retrain and progressively expand until they\nmatch or exceed the performance of the larger model. We demonstrate that\nInheritune enables the training of various sizes of GPT-2 models on datasets\nlike OpenWebText-9B and FineWeb_edu. Models trained with Inheritune, despite\nhaving significantly fewer layers, match or even surpass the performance of\ntheir larger counterparts. For instance, our 16-layer GPT-2 medium variant\nachieves comparable performance to the standard 24-layer GPT-2 medium model.\nCode is available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/LLM-Inheritune.",

However, as dataset scale increases, the training process\nbecomes increasingly inefficient due to the presence of low-value samples,\nincluding excessive redundant samples, overly challenging samples, and\ninefficient easy samples that contribute little to model improvement.To address\nthis challenge, we propose Scale Efficient Training (SeTa) for large datasets,\na dynamic sample pruning approach that losslessly reduces training time. To\nremove low-value samples, SeTa first performs random pruning to eliminate\nredundant samples, then clusters the remaining samples according to their\nlearning difficulty measured by loss. Building upon this clustering, a sliding\nwindow strategy is employed to progressively remove both overly challenging and\ninefficient easy clusters following an easy-to-hard curriculum.We conduct\nextensive experiments on large-scale synthetic datasets, including ToCa, SS1M,\nand ST+MJ, each containing over 3 million samples.SeTa reduces training costs\nby up to 50\\% while maintaining or improving performance, with minimal\ndegradation even at 70\\% cost reduction. Furthermore, experiments on various\nscale real datasets across various backbones (CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas)\nand diverse tasks (instruction tuning, multi-view stereo, geo-localization,\ncomposed image retrieval, referring image segmentation) demonstrate the\npowerful effectiveness and universality of our approach.

We investigate the impact of fine-tuning the\nLlama 3 model using TMs from a specific organisation in the software sector.\nOur experiments cover five translation directions across languages of varying\nresource levels (English to Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, German, Finnish, and\nKorean). We analyse diverse sizes of training datasets (1k to 207k segments) to\nevaluate their influence on translation quality. We fine-tune separate models\nfor each training set and evaluate their performance based on automatic\nmetrics, BLEU, chrF++, TER, and COMET. Our findings reveal improvement in\ntranslation performance with larger datasets across all metrics. On average,\nBLEU and COMET scores increase by 13 and 25 points, respectively, on the\nlargest training set against the baseline model.

The recent success of D2T is\nlargely attributed to advancements in LLMs. Despite the success of LLMs, no\nresearch has been conducted to illustrate the impact of model size on the\nperformance of fine-tuned LLMs for D2T tasks. D2T model performance is\ntypically assessed based on three key qualities: \\textit{readability}\n(indicates fluency and coherence), \\textit{informativeness} (measures content\nsimilarity), and \\textit{faithfulness} (assesses consistency of factual\ninformation). It is currently uncertain whether increasing the size of LLMs\neffectively improves performance in D2T tasks across these three qualities. The\nobjective of this study is to investigate the performance of fine-tuned LLMs in\nD2T tasks in terms of model size. Through extensive comparative analysis, we\naim to elucidate both the advantages and limitations of scaling model sizes\nacross five widely used D2T datasets (E2E, ViGGo, WikiTableText, DART, and\nWebNLG) and twelve state-of-the-art LLMs with varying sizes from five different\nLLM families (T5, BART, OPT, BLOOM, and Llama 2).

Our investigation reveals that increasing LLM\nsize enhances \\textit{readability} and \\textit{informativeness} in D2T tasks,\nbut larger (in terms of size) LLMs may sacrifice \\textit{faithfulness}.\nMoreover, small-sized LLMs show more resilience than larger ones when\nsource-reference divergence is present.",

By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to\nover 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for\ncompute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens\nshould be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of\ntraining tokens should also be doubled.

We study the scaling law of MoE-based LLMs regarding\nthe relations between the model performance, model size, dataset size, and the\nexpert degree. Echoing previous research studying MoE in different contexts, we\nobserve the diminishing return of increasing the number of experts, but this\nseems to suggest we should scale the number of experts until saturation, as the\ntraining cost would remain constant, which is problematic during inference\ntime. We propose to amend the scaling law of MoE by introducing inference\nefficiency as another metric besides the validation loss. We find that MoEs\nwith a few (4/8) experts are the most serving efficient solution under the same\nperformance, but costs 2.5-3.5x more in training. On the other hand, training a\n(16/32) expert MoE much smaller (70-85%) than the loss-optimal solution, but\nwith a larger training dataset is a promising setup under a training budget.",

However, their deployment is\ncostly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized\nalgorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large\npre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social\ncontexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use\nthem for Q&A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on\nin-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human\ninteraction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance\nthereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is\ntherefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations\nprovided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to\nnavigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned\nsmaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the\nsmaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its\nimprovements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the\ntraining examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely\ndifferent game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the\nsmaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the\nbehavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable\nbehavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the\nfine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an\nimprovement of 18% and 28% respectively.",

Current solutions to this problem leverage techniques explored in\nmachine learning privacy such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which\nheavily depend on LLMs' capability of verbatim memorization. However, this\nreliance presents challenges, especially given the vast amount of training data\nand the restricted number of effective training epochs. In this paper, we\npropose an adaptive pre-training data detection method which alleviates this\nreliance and effectively amplify the identification. Our method adaptively\nlocates \\textit{surprising tokens} of the input. A token is surprising to a LLM\nif the prediction on the token is \"certain but wrong\", which refers to low\nShannon entropy of the probability distribution and low probability of the\nground truth token at the same time. By using the prediction probability of\nsurprising tokens to measure \\textit{surprising}, the detection method is\nachieved based on the simple hypothesis that seeing seen data is less\nsurprising for the model compared with seeing unseen data. The method can be\napplied without any access to the the pre-training data corpus or additional\ntraining like reference models. Our approach exhibits a consistent enhancement\ncompared to existing methods in diverse experiments conducted on various\nbenchmarks and models, achieving a maximum improvement of 29.5\\%.

However, this principle only focuses on the model's\ncompression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with\nthe ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works\nattempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as\nhyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic\ndifferences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the\naforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of\nmodel capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through\nthis analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar\ntraining dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion\nparameters.

However, we observe that in\nstandard decoder-style LLMs, attention matrices degenerate to single-column for\ndeeper layers. Layers in this state are unable to learn anything meaningful and\nmostly redundant; we refer to these as lazy layers. The goal of this paper is\nto train smaller models by eliminating this structural inefficiency without\ncompromising performance.\n  Motivated by this observation, we propose Inheritune, a simple yet effective\ntraining recipe for developing smaller, high-performing language models.\nSmaller models trained with Inheritune, inherit early transformer layers from a\nlarger pre-trained model, then retrain and progressively expand until they\nmatch or exceed the performance of the larger model. We demonstrate that\nInheritune enables the training of various sizes of GPT-2 models on datasets\nlike OpenWebText-9B and FineWeb_edu. Models trained with Inheritune, despite\nhaving significantly fewer layers, match or even surpass the performance of\ntheir larger counterparts.

The existing scaling law\ndemonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training\nflops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for\nlarge language models. However, this principle only focuses on the model's\ncompression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with\nthe ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works\nattempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as\nhyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic\ndifferences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the\naforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of\nmodel capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through\nthis analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar\ntraining dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion\nparameters. In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and\nOpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints. This initiative offers\nvaluable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification\nand exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. Besides, we\nprovide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different\nmodels and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training\nphases.

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of\nour datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for\nunderstanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language\nmodels, and practically improving their performance.",

With the goal of disentangling the factors\ninfluencing LLM performance, we investigate whether instruction-tuned models\npossess fundamentally different capabilities from base models that are prompted\nusing in-context examples. Through extensive experiments across various model\nfamilies, scales and task types, which included instruction tuning 90 different\nLLMs, we demonstrate that the performance of instruction-tuned models is\nsignificantly correlated with the in-context performance of their base\ncounterparts. By clarifying what instruction-tuning contributes, we extend\nprior research into in-context learning, which suggests that base models use\npriors from pretraining data to solve tasks.

While large language models (LLMs)\nhave revealed remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capability for general zero\nand few-shot learning, recent studies indicate that current LLMs still struggle\nwith zero and few-shot RE. Previous studies are mainly dedicated to design\nprompt formats and select good examples for improving ICL-based RE. Although\nboth factors are vital for ICL, if one can fundamentally boost the ICL\ncapability of LLMs in RE, the zero and few-shot RE performance via ICL would be\nsignificantly improved. To this end, we introduce \\textsc{Micre} (\\textbf{M}eta\n\\textbf{I}n-\\textbf{C}ontext learning of LLMs for \\textbf{R}elation\n\\textbf{E}xtraction), a new meta-training framework for zero and few-shot RE\nwhere an LLM is tuned to do ICL on a diverse collection of RE datasets (i.e.,\nlearning to learn in context for RE). Through meta-training, the model becomes\nmore effectively to learn a new RE task in context by conditioning on a few\ntraining examples with no parameter updates or task-specific templates at\ninference time, enabling better zero and few-shot task generalization. We\nexperiment \\textsc{Micre} on various LLMs with different model scales and 12\npublic RE datasets, and then evaluate it on unseen RE benchmarks under zero and\nfew-shot settings. \\textsc{Micre} delivers comparable or superior performance\ncompared to a range of baselines including supervised fine-tuning and typical\nin-context learning methods. We find that the gains are particular significant\nfor larger model scales, and using a diverse set of the meta-training RE\ndatasets is key to improvements. Empirically, we show that \\textsc{Micre} can\ntransfer the relation semantic knowledge via relation label name during\ninference on target RE datasets.",

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of\nour datasets and other benchmarks.

In this paper,\nfor LLMs utilizing RoPE as position embeddings, we introduce a novel method\ncalled \"Mixture of In-Context Experts\" (MoICE) to address this challenge. MoICE\ncomprises two key components: a router integrated into each attention head\nwithin LLMs and a lightweight router-only training optimization strategy: (1)\nMoICE views each RoPE angle as an `in-context' expert, demonstrated to be\ncapable of directing the attention of a head to specific contextual positions.\nConsequently, each attention head flexibly processes tokens using multiple RoPE\nangles dynamically selected by the router to attend to the needed positions.\nThis approach mitigates the risk of overlooking essential contextual\ninformation. (2) The router-only training strategy entails freezing LLM\nparameters and exclusively updating routers for only a few steps.

Despite its effectiveness, the mechanism behind ICL\nremains underexplored. To better understand how ICL integrates the examples\nwith the knowledge learned by the LLM during pre-training (i.e., pre-training\nknowledge) and how the examples impact ICL, this paper conducts a theoretical\nstudy in binary classification tasks. In particular, we introduce a\nprobabilistic model extending from the Gaussian mixture model to exactly\nquantify the impact of pre-training knowledge, label frequency, and label noise\non the prediction accuracy. Based on our analysis, when the pre-training\nknowledge contradicts the knowledge in the examples, whether ICL prediction\nrelies more on the pre-training knowledge or the examples depends on the number\nof examples. In addition, the label frequency and label noise of the examples\nboth affect the accuracy of the ICL prediction, where the minor class has a\nlower accuracy, and how the label noise impacts the accuracy is determined by\nthe specific noise level of the two classes. Extensive simulations are\nconducted to verify the correctness of the theoretical results, and real-data\nexperiments also align with the theoretical insights. Our work reveals the role\nof pre-training knowledge and examples in ICL, offering a deeper understanding\nof LLMs' behaviors in classification tasks.",

We investigate two setups-ICL with\nflipped labels and ICL with semantically-unrelated labels-across various model\nfamilies (GPT-3, InstructGPT, Codex, PaLM, and Flan-PaLM). First, experiments\non ICL with flipped labels show that overriding semantic priors is an emergent\nability of model scale. While small language models ignore flipped labels\npresented in-context and thus rely primarily on semantic priors from\npretraining, large models can override semantic priors when presented with\nin-context exemplars that contradict priors, despite the stronger semantic\npriors that larger models may hold. We next study semantically-unrelated label\nICL (SUL-ICL), in which labels are semantically unrelated to their inputs\n(e.g., foo/bar instead of negative/positive), thereby forcing language models\nto learn the input-label mappings shown in in-context exemplars in order to\nperform the task. The ability to do SUL-ICL also emerges primarily with scale,\nand large-enough language models can even perform linear classification in a\nSUL-ICL setting. Finally, we evaluate instruction-tuned models and find that\ninstruction tuning strengthens both the use of semantic priors and the capacity\nto learn input-label mappings, but more of the former.",

Through the\nICLEval benchmark, we demonstrate that ICL ability is universally present in\ndifferent LLMs, and model size is not the sole determinant of ICL efficacy.\nSurprisingly, we observe that ICL abilities, particularly copying, develop\nearly in the pretraining process and stabilize afterward. Our source codes and\nbenchmark are released at https://github.com/yiye3/ICLEval.",

The generation of a single frame requires the model to process\nthe entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by\nadapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive\ntransformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we\nextend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step\ndiffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality\ndistillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's\nODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that\nsupervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach\neffectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing\nlong-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model\nachieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all\nprevious video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of\nhigh-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our\napproach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and\ndynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an\nopen-source model in the future.",

A majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate long videos\nin an autoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on\nlast frames of previous clip. However, existing approaches all involve\nbidirectional computations, which restricts the receptive context of each\nautoregression step, and results in the model lacking long-term dependencies.\nInspired from the huge success of large language models (LLMs) and following\nGPT (generative pre-trained transformer), we bring causal (i.e.,\nunidirectional) generation into VDMs, and use past frames as prompt to generate\nfuture frames. For Causal Generation, we introduce causal temporal attention\ninto VDM, which forces each generated frame to depend on its previous frames.\nFor Frame as Prompt, we inject the conditional frames by concatenating them\nwith noisy frames (frames to be generated) along the temporal axis.\nConsequently, we present Video Diffusion GPT (ViD-GPT). Based on the two key\ndesigns, in each autoregression step, it is able to acquire long-term context\nfrom prompting frames concatenated by all previously generated frames.\nAdditionally, we bring the kv-cache mechanism to VDMs, which eliminates the\nredundant computation from overlapped frames, significantly boosting the\ninference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ViD-GPT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on long\nvideo generation.

Our method generates\ntokens along diagonal paths in the spatial-temporal token grid, enabling\nparallel decoding within each frame as well as partially overlapping across\nconsecutive frames. The proposed algorithm is versatile and adaptive to various\ngenerative models and tasks, while providing flexible control over the\ntrade-off between inference speed and visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a\ncost-effective finetuning strategy that aligns the attention patterns of the\nmodel with our decoding order, further mitigating the training-inference gap on\nsmall-scale models. Experiments on multiple autoregressive video generation\nmodels and datasets demonstrate that DiagD achieves up to $10\\times$ speedup\ncompared to naive sequential decoding, while maintaining comparable visual\nfidelity.",

To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is\ncomputationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language\ntokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range\ndependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution\nshort-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an\nunlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer\ntokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a\nmanageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time\nand memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to\nsupport the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on\nlong video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet\neffective baseline for video autoregressive modeling.

VideoGPT uses VQ-VAE\nthat learns downsampled discrete latent representations of a raw video by\nemploying 3D convolutions and axial self-attention. A simple GPT-like\narchitecture is then used to autoregressively model the discrete latents using\nspatio-temporal position encodings. Despite the simplicity in formulation and\nease of training, our architecture is able to generate samples competitive with\nstate-of-the-art GAN models for video generation on the BAIR Robot dataset, and\ngenerate high fidelity natural videos from UCF-101 and Tumbler GIF Dataset\n(TGIF). We hope our proposed architecture serves as a reproducible reference\nfor a minimalistic implementation of transformer based video generation models.\nSamples and code are available at\nhttps://wilson1yan.github.io/videogpt/index.html",

It is used to capture temporal dynamics, thereby ensuring\nthe production of consistent frames and seamless motion transitions. The motion\nmodule can be adapted to various DiT baseline methods to generate video with\ndifferent styles. It can also generate videos with different frame rates and\nresolutions during both training and inference phases, suitable for both images\nand videos. Moreover, we introduce slice VAE, a novel approach to condense the\ntemporal axis, facilitating the generation of long duration videos. Currently,\nEasyAnimate exhibits the proficiency to generate videos with 144 frames. We\nprovide a holistic ecosystem for video production based on DiT, encompassing\naspects such as data pre-processing, VAE training, DiT models training (both\nthe baseline model and LoRA model), and end-to-end video inference. Code is\navailable at: https://github.com/aigc-apps/EasyAnimate. We are continuously\nworking to enhance the performance of our method.",

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a\nsignificant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing\nhigh-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on\nsubword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can\nvary in different levels, \\textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or\nscale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data\ncompared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively\nexamines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve\nreadability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with\npreliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the\nfundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general\nsub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models\nbased on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections\nbetween autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we\npresent a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer\nvision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and\nmulti-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse\ndomains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with\nabout 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to\nautoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research\ndirections.

Furthermore, we offer a\ncomprehensive overview and classification of the datasets and evaluation\nmetrics which are crucial for advancing long video generation research.\nConcluding with a summary of existing studies, we also discuss the emerging\nchallenges and future directions in this dynamic field.

            "abstract": "Autoregressive transformers have shown remarkable success in video\ngeneration. However, the transformers are prohibited from directly learning the\nlong-term dependency in videos due to the quadratic complexity of\nself-attention, and inherently suffering from slow inference time and error\npropagation due to the autoregressive process. In this paper, we propose\nMemory-efficient Bidirectional Transformer (MeBT) for end-to-end learning of\nlong-term dependency in videos and fast inference. Based on recent advances in\nbidirectional transformers, our method learns to decode the entire\nspatio-temporal volume of a video in parallel from partially observed patches.\nThe proposed transformer achieves a linear time complexity in both encoding and\ndecoding, by projecting observable context tokens into a fixed number of latent\ntokens and conditioning them to decode the masked tokens through the\ncross-attention. Empowered by linear complexity and bidirectional modeling, our\nmethod demonstrates significant improvement over the autoregressive\nTransformers for generating moderately long videos in both quality and speed.\nVideos and code are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mebt-cvpr2023 .",

Nevertheless, due to limitations in data and computational\nresources, achieving efficient generation of long videos with rich motion\ndynamics remains a significant challenge. To generate high-quality, dynamic,\nand temporally consistent long videos, this paper presents ARLON, a novel\nframework that boosts diffusion Transformers with autoregressive models for\nlong video generation, by integrating the coarse spatial and long-range\ntemporal information provided by the AR model to guide the DiT model.\nSpecifically, ARLON incorporates several key innovations: 1) A latent Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) compresses the input latent space of\nthe DiT model into compact visual tokens, bridging the AR and DiT models and\nbalancing the learning complexity and information density; 2) An adaptive\nnorm-based semantic injection module integrates the coarse discrete visual\nunits from the AR model into the DiT model, ensuring effective guidance during\nvideo generation; 3) To enhance the tolerance capability of noise introduced\nfrom the AR inference, the DiT model is trained with coarser visual latent\ntokens incorporated with an uncertainty sampling module. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ARLON significantly outperforms the baseline OpenSora-V1.2 on\neight out of eleven metrics selected from VBench, with notable improvements in\ndynamic degree and aesthetic quality, while delivering competitive results on\nthe remaining three and simultaneously accelerating the generation process. In\naddition, ARLON achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video generation.\nDetailed analyses of the improvements in inference efficiency are presented,\nalongside a practical application that demonstrates the generation of long\nvideos using progressive text prompts.

In this paper, we propose Diagonal Decoding (DiagD), a training-free\ninference acceleration algorithm for autoregressively pre-trained models that\nexploits spatial and temporal correlations in videos. Our method generates\ntokens along diagonal paths in the spatial-temporal token grid, enabling\nparallel decoding within each frame as well as partially overlapping across\nconsecutive frames. The proposed algorithm is versatile and adaptive to various\ngenerative models and tasks, while providing flexible control over the\ntrade-off between inference speed and visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a\ncost-effective finetuning strategy that aligns the attention patterns of the\nmodel with our decoding order, further mitigating the training-inference gap on\nsmall-scale models. Experiments on multiple autoregressive video generation\nmodels and datasets demonstrate that DiagD achieves up to $10\\times$ speedup\ncompared to naive sequential decoding, while maintaining comparable visual\nfidelity.",

On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual\nspeech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement\ninformation, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we\npropose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition\ncapabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce\nmodality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by\na pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an\nauto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable\nparameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained\nwhereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our\nproposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve\nnew state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.79%\nand 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors\nthat underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained\nencoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal\nperformance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.",

As such, one natural question arises: Is it possible to have a\nunified model for both understanding and generation? To answer this question,\nin this paper, we first provide a detailed review of both MLLM and diffusion\nmodels, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal\narchitecture design, and advanced applications to image/video large language\nmodels as well as text-to-image/video generation. Then, we discuss the two\nimportant questions on the unified model: i) whether the unified model should\nadopt the auto-regressive or diffusion probabilistic modeling, and ii) whether\nthe model should utilize a dense architecture or the Mixture of Experts(MoE)\narchitectures to better support generation and understanding, two objectives.\nWe further provide several possible strategies for building a unified model and\nanalyze their potential advantages and disadvantages.

For example,\nwhile synthetic captions often provide superior quality and image-text\nalignment, it is not clear whether they can fully replace AltTexts: the role of\nsynthetic captions and their interaction with original web-crawled AltTexts in\npre-training is still not well understood. Moreover, different multimodal\nfoundation models may have unique preferences for specific caption formats, but\nefforts to identify the optimal captions for each model remain limited. In this\nwork, we propose a novel, controllable, and scalable captioning pipeline\ndesigned to generate diverse caption formats tailored to various multimodal\nmodels. By examining Short Synthetic Captions (SSC) towards Dense Synthetic\nCaptions (DSC+) as case studies, we systematically explore their effects and\ninteractions with AltTexts across models such as CLIP, multimodal LLMs, and\ndiffusion models. Our findings reveal that a hybrid approach that keeps both\nsynthetic captions and AltTexts can outperform the use of synthetic captions\nalone, improving both alignment and performance, with each model demonstrating\npreferences for particular caption formats.

Possible applications for\nMLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning,\nfostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and\nfeedback.

As such, one natural question arises: Is it possible to have a\nunified model for both understanding and generation? To answer this question,\nin this paper, we first provide a detailed review of both MLLM and diffusion\nmodels, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal\narchitecture design, and advanced applications to image/video large language\nmodels as well as text-to-image/video generation. Then, we discuss the two\nimportant questions on the unified model: i) whether the unified model should\nadopt the auto-regressive or diffusion probabilistic modeling, and ii) whether\nthe model should utilize a dense architecture or the Mixture of Experts(MoE)\narchitectures to better support generation and understanding, two objectives.\nWe further provide several possible strategies for building a unified model and\nanalyze their potential advantages and disadvantages.

However, it is challenging to characterize\nand study progress in multimodal foundation models, given the range of possible\nmodeling decisions, tasks, and domains. In this paper, we introduce Holistic\nEvaluation of Multimodal Models (HEMM) to systematically evaluate the\ncapabilities of multimodal foundation models across a set of 3 dimensions:\nbasic skills, information flow, and real-world use cases. Basic multimodal\nskills are internal abilities required to solve problems, such as learning\ninteractions across modalities, fine-grained alignment, multi-step reasoning,\nand the ability to handle external knowledge. Information flow studies how\nmultimodal content changes during a task through querying, translation,\nediting, and fusion. Use cases span domain-specific challenges introduced in\nreal-world multimedia, affective computing, natural sciences, healthcare, and\nhuman-computer interaction applications. Through comprehensive experiments\nacross the 30 tasks in HEMM, we (1) identify key dataset dimensions (e.g.,\nbasic skills, information flows, and use cases) that pose challenges to today's\nmodels, and (2) distill performance trends regarding how different modeling\ndimensions (e.g., scale, pre-training data, multimodal alignment, pre-training,\nand instruction tuning objectives) influence performance. Our conclusions\nregarding challenging multimodal interactions, use cases, and tasks requiring\nreasoning and external knowledge, the benefits of data and model scale, and the\nimpacts of instruction tuning yield actionable insights for future work in\nmultimodal foundation models.",

The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from\nvision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both\nimage and video understanding benchmarks.",

However, existing research\nprimarily focuses on tuning language and image instructions, ignoring the\ncritical pretraining phase where models learn to process textual and visual\nmodalities jointly. In this paper, we propose a new pretraining paradigm for\nLMMs to enhance the visual comprehension capabilities of LLMs by introducing a\nnovel cross-modal comprehension stage. Specifically, we design a dynamically\nlearnable prompt token pool and employ the Hungarian algorithm to replace part\nof the original visual tokens with the most relevant prompt tokens. Then, we\nconceptualize visual tokens as analogous to a \"foreign language\" for the LLMs\nand propose a mixed attention mechanism with bidirectional visual attention and\nunidirectional textual attention to comprehensively enhance the understanding\nof visual tokens. Meanwhile, we integrate a detailed caption generation task,\nleveraging rich descriptions to further facilitate LLMs in understanding visual\nsemantic information. After pretraining on 1.5 million publicly accessible\ndata, we present a new foundation model called Croc. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that Croc achieves new state-of-the-art performance on massive\nvision-language benchmarks.

However, due to the unevenness of data distribution including\nsize, task type and quality, using the mixture of multiple datasets for model\ntraining can be problematic. In this work, we introduce a large-scale\nmulti-modal corpora named WuDaoMM, totally containing more than 650M image-text\npairs.

            "abstract": "With the urgent demand for generalized deep models, many pre-trained big\nmodels are proposed, such as BERT, ViT, GPT, etc. Inspired by the success of\nthese models in single domains (like computer vision and natural language\nprocessing), the multi-modal pre-trained big models have also drawn more and\nmore attention in recent years. In this work, we give a comprehensive survey of\nthese models and hope this paper could provide new insights and helps fresh\nresearchers to track the most cutting-edge works. Specifically, we firstly\nintroduce the background of multi-modal pre-training by reviewing the\nconventional deep learning, pre-training works in natural language process,\ncomputer vision, and speech. Then, we introduce the task definition, key\nchallenges, and advantages of multi-modal pre-training models (MM-PTMs), and\ndiscuss the MM-PTMs with a focus on data, objectives, network architectures,\nand knowledge enhanced pre-training. After that, we introduce the downstream\ntasks used for the validation of large-scale MM-PTMs, including generative,\nclassification, and regression tasks. We also give visualization and analysis\nof the model parameters and results on representative downstream tasks.\nFinally, we point out possible research directions for this topic that may\nbenefit future works.

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal models highlight the value of rewritten\ncaptions for improving performance, yet key challenges remain. For example,\nwhile synthetic captions often provide superior quality and image-text\nalignment, it is not clear whether they can fully replace AltTexts: the role of\nsynthetic captions and their interaction with original web-crawled AltTexts in\npre-training is still not well understood. Moreover, different multimodal\nfoundation models may have unique preferences for specific caption formats, but\nefforts to identify the optimal captions for each model remain limited. In this\nwork, we propose a novel, controllable, and scalable captioning pipeline\ndesigned to generate diverse caption formats tailored to various multimodal\nmodels. By examining Short Synthetic Captions (SSC) towards Dense Synthetic\nCaptions (DSC+) as case studies, we systematically explore their effects and\ninteractions with AltTexts across models such as CLIP, multimodal LLMs, and\ndiffusion models. Our findings reveal that a hybrid approach that keeps both\nsynthetic captions and AltTexts can outperform the use of synthetic captions\nalone, improving both alignment and performance, with each model demonstrating\npreferences for particular caption formats. This comprehensive analysis\nprovides valuable insights into optimizing captioning strategies, thereby\nadvancing the pre-training of multimodal foundation models.",

For\nexample, in the audio and speech domains, an LLM can be equipped with\n(automatic) speech recognition (ASR) abilities by just concatenating the audio\ntokens, computed with an audio encoder, and the text tokens to achieve\nstate-of-the-art results. On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual\nspeech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement\ninformation, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we\npropose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition\ncapabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce\nmodality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by\na pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an\nauto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable\nparameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained\nwhereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our\nproposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve\nnew state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.79%\nand 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors\nthat underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained\nencoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal\nperformance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.",

Particularly, two dominant families of techniques are: i) The\nmulti-modal large language model (MLLM) such as GPT-4V, which shows impressive\nability for multi-modal understanding; ii) The diffusion model such as Sora,\nwhich exhibits remarkable multi-modal powers, especially with respect to visual\ngeneration. As such, one natural question arises: Is it possible to have a\nunified model for both understanding and generation? To answer this question,\nin this paper, we first provide a detailed review of both MLLM and diffusion\nmodels, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal\narchitecture design, and advanced applications to image/video large language\nmodels as well as text-to-image/video generation. Then, we discuss the two\nimportant questions on the unified model: i) whether the unified model should\nadopt the auto-regressive or diffusion probabilistic modeling, and ii) whether\nthe model should utilize a dense architecture or the Mixture of Experts(MoE)\narchitectures to better support generation and understanding, two objectives.\nWe further provide several possible strategies for building a unified model and\nanalyze their potential advantages and disadvantages. We also summarize\nexisting large-scale multi-modal datasets for better model pretraining in the\nfuture.

However, it is challenging to characterize\nand study progress in multimodal foundation models, given the range of possible\nmodeling decisions, tasks, and domains. In this paper, we introduce Holistic\nEvaluation of Multimodal Models (HEMM) to systematically evaluate the\ncapabilities of multimodal foundation models across a set of 3 dimensions:\nbasic skills, information flow, and real-world use cases. Basic multimodal\nskills are internal abilities required to solve problems, such as learning\ninteractions across modalities, fine-grained alignment, multi-step reasoning,\nand the ability to handle external knowledge. Information flow studies how\nmultimodal content changes during a task through querying, translation,\nediting, and fusion. Use cases span domain-specific challenges introduced in\nreal-world multimedia, affective computing, natural sciences, healthcare, and\nhuman-computer interaction applications. Through comprehensive experiments\nacross the 30 tasks in HEMM, we (1) identify key dataset dimensions (e.g.,\nbasic skills, information flows, and use cases) that pose challenges to today's\nmodels, and (2) distill performance trends regarding how different modeling\ndimensions (e.g., scale, pre-training data, multimodal alignment, pre-training,\nand instruction tuning objectives) influence performance. Our conclusions\nregarding challenging multimodal interactions, use cases, and tasks requiring\nreasoning and external knowledge, the benefits of data and model scale, and the\nimpacts of instruction tuning yield actionable insights for future work in\nmultimodal foundation models.",

The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from\nvision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both\nimage and video understanding benchmarks.",

As such, one natural question arises: Is it possible to have a\nunified model for both understanding and generation? To answer this question,\nin this paper, we first provide a detailed review of both MLLM and diffusion\nmodels, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal\narchitecture design, and advanced applications to image/video large language\nmodels as well as text-to-image/video generation. Then, we discuss the two\nimportant questions on the unified model: i) whether the unified model should\nadopt the auto-regressive or diffusion probabilistic modeling, and ii) whether\nthe model should utilize a dense architecture or the Mixture of Experts(MoE)\narchitectures to better support generation and understanding, two objectives.\nWe further provide several possible strategies for building a unified model and\nanalyze their potential advantages and disadvantages. We also summarize\nexisting large-scale multi-modal datasets for better model pretraining in the\nfuture.

Next, the open-ended text output is parsed into an\nexecutable action to interact with the environment to obtain goal-directed task\nrewards. Finally, our framework uses these task rewards to fine-tune the entire\nVLM with RL.

RLHF\ncontains three steps, i.e., human preference collecting, reward learning, and\npolicy optimization, which are usually performed serially. Despite its\npopularity, however, (fixed) reward models may suffer from inaccurate\noff-distribution, since policy optimization continuously shifts LLMs' data\ndistribution. Repeatedly collecting new preference data from the latest LLMs\nmay alleviate this issue, which unfortunately makes the resulting system more\ncomplicated and difficult to optimize. In this paper, we propose reward\nlearning on policy (RLP), an unsupervised framework that refines a reward model\nusing policy samples to keep it on-distribution. Specifically, an unsupervised\nmulti-view learning method is introduced to learn robust representations of\npolicy samples. Meanwhile, a synthetic preference generation approach is\ndeveloped to simulate high-quality preference data with policy outputs.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that RLP consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art.

With the\nadvancement of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), the ability to\ncode stands out as one important measure to the model's reasoning performance.\nUsually, a two-stage training paradigm is implemented to obtain a Code LLM,\nnamely the pretraining and the fine-tuning. Within the fine-tuning, supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) are often used to improve\nthe model's zero-shot ability. A large number of work has been conducted to\nimprove the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either\nmodifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still\nlack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what\nkind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon\nthe SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand\nthe correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually\ncraft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a\nsynthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic\nfunctions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train\nand test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through\ncomprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions\nare indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic\nfunctions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target\ndomain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3)\nTraining RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the\nSFT phase.",

To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied\napproach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to\nan optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

However, current work typically relies\non prompt design or fine-tuning strategies applied to vanilla LLMs, which often\nleads to limited effectiveness or suboptimal performance in complex\nagent-related environments. Although LLM optimization techniques can improve\nmodel performance across many general tasks, they lack specialized optimization\ntowards critical agent functionalities such as long-term planning, dynamic\nenvironmental interaction, and complex decision-making. Although numerous\nrecent studies have explored various strategies to optimize LLM-based agents\nfor complex agent tasks, a systematic review summarizing and comparing these\nmethods from a holistic perspective is still lacking. In this survey, we\nprovide a comprehensive review of LLM-based agent optimization approaches,\ncategorizing them into parameter-driven and parameter-free methods. We first\nfocus on parameter-driven optimization, covering fine-tuning-based\noptimization, reinforcement learning-based optimization, and hybrid strategies,\nanalyzing key aspects such as trajectory data construction, fine-tuning\ntechniques, reward function design, and optimization algorithms. Additionally,\nwe briefly discuss parameter-free strategies that optimize agent behavior\nthrough prompt engineering and external knowledge retrieval.

However,\nexisting works have primarily focused on structured environments relying on\nmeticulously crafted representations of tasks, thereby limiting the agent's\nability to generalize skills across tasks. In this paper, we aim to enhance the\ngeneralization capabilities of agents in open-ended text-based learning\nenvironments by integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Large Language\nModels (LLMs). We investigate three types of agents: (i) RL-based agents that\nutilize natural language for state and action representations to find the best\ninteraction strategy, (ii) LLM-based agents that leverage the model's general\nknowledge and reasoning through prompting, and (iii) hybrid LLM-assisted RL\nagents that combine these two strategies to improve agents' performance and\ngeneralization. To support the development and evaluation of these agents, we\nintroduce PharmaSimText, a novel benchmark derived from the PharmaSim virtual\npharmacy environment designed for practicing diagnostic conversations. Our\nresults show that RL-based agents excel in task completion but lack in asking\nquality diagnostic questions. In contrast, LLM-based agents perform better in\nasking diagnostic questions but fall short of completing the task.

To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied\napproach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to\nan optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

            "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with web search capabilities have\ndemonstrated impressive potential for deep research tasks. However, current\napproaches predominantly rely on either manually engineered prompts (prompt\nengineering-based) with brittle performance or reinforcement learning within\ncontrolled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) environments (RAG-based) that\nfail to capture the complexities of real-world interaction. In this paper, we\nintroduce DeepResearcher, the first comprehensive framework for end-to-end\ntraining of LLM-based deep research agents through scaling reinforcement\nlearning (RL) in real-world environments with authentic web search\ninteractions. Unlike RAG-based approaches that assume all necessary information\nexists within a fixed corpus, our method trains agents to navigate the noisy,\nunstructured, and dynamic nature of the open web. We implement a specialized\nmulti-agent architecture where browsing agents extract relevant information\nfrom various webpage structures and overcoming significant technical\nchallenges. Extensive experiments on open-domain research tasks demonstrate\nthat DeepResearcher achieves substantial improvements of up to 28.9 points over\nprompt engineering-based baselines and up to 7.2 points over RAG-based RL\nagents. Our qualitative analysis reveals emergent cognitive behaviors from\nend-to-end RL training, including the ability to formulate plans,\ncross-validate information from multiple sources, engage in self-reflection to\nredirect research, and maintain honesty when unable to find definitive answers.\nOur results highlight that end-to-end training in real-world web environments\nis not merely an implementation detail but a fundamental requirement for\ndeveloping robust research capabilities aligned with real-world applications.\nWe release DeepResearcher at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/DeepResearcher.",

To\naddress these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's\nself-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we\nfirst show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline\nmodel-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling\nself-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT falls\nprey to either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the\ndata-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to behavior collapse,\nwhere learning implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior\nthat is often not effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe\naddresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of\nself-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer\nthe learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective\nat test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt.\nThis regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a\nbase model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to\ncollapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With\nGemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves\nstate-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models'\nself-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on MATH and HumanEval.",

Besides,\nwe analyze the source of this sensitivity by examining the model's internal\nrepresentations and salient tokens. Finally, we propose to use a contrastive\nloss to mitigate this sensitivity and improve the robustness and generalization\ncapabilities of LLMs.",

In this paper, we first investigate the root causes of\nhallucinations in LVLMs. Our findings reveal that existing mitigation\ntechniques primarily reduce hallucinations for visual recognition prompts-those\nthat require simple descriptions of visual elements-but fail for cognitive\nprompts that demand deliberate reasoning. We identify the core issue as a lack\nof true visual perception in LVLMs: although they can accurately recognize\nvisual elements, they struggle to fully interpret these elements in the context\nof the input prompt and effectively link this recognition to their internal\nknowledge, which is critical for reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce\nVisual Description Grounded Decoding (VDGD), a simple, robust, and\ntraining-free method designed to enhance visual perception and improve\nreasoning capabilities in LVLMs. VDGD works by first generating a detailed\ndescription of the image and appending it as a prefix to the instruction.\nDuring response generation, tokens are sampled based on their KL divergence to\nthe description, favoring candidates with lower divergence. Experimental\nresults on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate that VDGD\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines 2% - 33%.

We propose a new alignment\nalgorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with\nadditional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth\nmulti-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF\nand further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated\ntraining data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available\nhuman-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our\nmodel. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a\nnew evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing\nhallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves\nremarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 94% performance\nlevel of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the\n87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages\nself-feedback as visual cues. Building on this approach, we introduce Volcano,\na multimodal self-feedback guided revision model. Volcano generates natural\nlanguage feedback to its initial response based on the provided visual\ninformation and utilizes this feedback to self-revise its initial response.\nVolcano effectively reduces multimodal hallucination and achieves\nstate-of-the-art on MMHal-Bench, POPE, and GAVIE. It also improves on general\nmultimodal abilities and outperforms previous models on MM-Vet and MMBench.\nThrough qualitative analysis, we show that Volcano's feedback is properly\ngrounded on the image than the initial response. This indicates that Volcano\ncan provide itself with richer visual information through feedback generation,\nleading to self-correct hallucinations.

Specifically, LVLMs\noften predominantly attend to prompt-irrelevant global features instead of\nprompt-relevant local features, undermining their visual grounding capacity and\nleading to object hallucinations. We propose Assembly of Global and Local\nAttention (AGLA), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates\nhallucinations by assembling global features for response generation and local\nfeatures for visual discrimination simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce\nan image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features\nfrom images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where\nprompt-relevant content is highlighted while irrelevant distractions are\nsuppressed. Hallucinations can thus be mitigated with a calibrated logit\ndistribution that is from generative global features of the original image and\ndiscriminative local features of the augmented image.

Existing methods largely use closed-vocabulary\nobject lists to mitigate or evaluate hallucinations in image captioning,\nignoring the long-tailed nature of hallucinations that occur in practice. To\nthis end, we propose a framework for addressing hallucinations in image\ncaptioning in the open-vocabulary setting. Our framework includes a new\nbenchmark, OpenCHAIR, that leverages generative foundation models to evaluate\nopen-vocabulary object hallucinations for image captioning, surpassing the\npopular and similarly-sized CHAIR benchmark in both diversity and accuracy.\nFurthermore, to mitigate open-vocabulary hallucinations without using a closed\nobject list, we propose MOCHa, an approach harnessing advancements in\nreinforcement learning. Our multi-objective reward function explicitly targets\nthe trade-off between fidelity and adequacy in generations without requiring\nany strong supervision. MOCHa improves a large variety of image captioning\nmodels, as captured by our OpenCHAIR benchmark and other existing metrics.

Moreover, when transferred to\naugmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even\nexacerbated.Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we\nintroduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large\nvision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by\nincorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets\nbased on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the\nmost effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval\nresults. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low\ncertainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high\ncertainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing\nhallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and\nmPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks. Our empirical observations suggest that by\nutilizing fitting retrieval mechanisms and timing the retrieval judiciously, we\ncan effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. We hope that this study can\nprovide deeper insights into how to adapt the retrieval augmentation to LVLMs\nfor reducing hallucinations with more effective retrieval and minimal retrieval\noccurrences.",

While\nhallucinations are well-studied, the exact causes behind them remain\nunderexplored. In this paper, we first investigate the root causes of\nhallucinations in LVLMs. Our findings reveal that existing mitigation\ntechniques primarily reduce hallucinations for visual recognition prompts-those\nthat require simple descriptions of visual elements-but fail for cognitive\nprompts that demand deliberate reasoning. We identify the core issue as a lack\nof true visual perception in LVLMs: although they can accurately recognize\nvisual elements, they struggle to fully interpret these elements in the context\nof the input prompt and effectively link this recognition to their internal\nknowledge, which is critical for reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce\nVisual Description Grounded Decoding (VDGD), a simple, robust, and\ntraining-free method designed to enhance visual perception and improve\nreasoning capabilities in LVLMs. VDGD works by first generating a detailed\ndescription of the image and appending it as a prefix to the instruction.\nDuring response generation, tokens are sampled based on their KL divergence to\nthe description, favoring candidates with lower divergence. Experimental\nresults on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate that VDGD\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines 2% - 33%. Finally, we introduce\nVaLLu, a benchmark designed for comprehensive evaluation of the cognitive\ncapabilities of LVLMs.",

This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in\nvideo modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static\nmodalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a\ncomprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in\nvideo understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e.,\nhallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in\n6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on\nhallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model\nreasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition,\ninspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking\nmodel to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning\nfine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT\nenhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the\nthinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the\neffectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on\nhallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%.

They have attracted significant attention and been\ndeployed in numerous downstream applications. Nevertheless, akin to a\ndouble-edged sword, LLMs also present potential risks. They could suffer from\nprivate data leaks or yield inappropriate, harmful, or misleading content.\nAdditionally, the rapid progress of LLMs raises concerns about the potential\nemergence of superintelligent systems without adequate safeguards. To\neffectively capitalize on LLM capacities as well as ensure their safe and\nbeneficial development, it is critical to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive\nevaluation of LLMs.\n  This survey endeavors to offer a panoramic perspective on the evaluation of\nLLMs. We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups: knowledge\nand capability evaluation, alignment evaluation and safety evaluation. In\naddition to the comprehensive review on the evaluation methodologies and\nbenchmarks on these three aspects, we collate a compendium of evaluations\npertaining to LLMs' performance in specialized domains, and discuss the\nconstruction of comprehensive evaluation platforms that cover LLM evaluations\non capabilities, alignment, safety, and applicability.\n  We hope that this comprehensive overview will stimulate further research\ninterests in the evaluation of LLMs, with the ultimate goal of making\nevaluation serve as a cornerstone in guiding the responsible development of\nLLMs. We envision that this will channel their evolution into a direction that\nmaximizes societal benefit while minimizing potential risks.

However, current\nbenchmarks are often simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well and\nmaking it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks\ntypically rely on static question-answer pairs that the models might memorize\nor guess. To address these limitations, we introduce Dynamic Intelligence\nAssessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic\nquestion templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as\nmathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The\naccompanying dataset, DIA-Bench, contains a diverse collection of challenge\ntemplates with mutable parameters presented in various formats, including text,\nPDFs, compiled binaries, visual puzzles, and CTF-style cybersecurity\nchallenges. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's\nreliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed\nthat even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in\nvarying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably,\nAPI models like GPT-4o often overestimated their mathematical capabilities,\nwhile ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better performance due to effective tool usage.\nIn self-assessment, OpenAI's o1-mini proved to have the best judgement on what\ntasks it should attempt to solve. We evaluated 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using\nDIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often\ndisplay unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions. The DIA\nframework sets a new standard for assessing not only problem-solving but also a\nmodel's adaptive intelligence and ability to assess its limitations.

However, language models\noften face challenges when given extensive information, diminishing their\neffectiveness in solving questions. Context compression tackles this issue by\nfiltering out irrelevant information, but current methods still struggle in\nrealistic scenarios where crucial information cannot be captured with a\nsingle-step approach. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CompAct, a\nnovel framework that employs an active strategy to condense extensive documents\nwithout losing key information. Our experiments demonstrate that CompAct brings\nsignificant improvements in both performance and compression rate on multi-hop\nquestion-answering benchmarks. CompAct flexibly operates as a cost-efficient\nplug-in module with various off-the-shelf retrievers or readers, achieving\nexceptionally high compression rates (47x).",

We used two pretrained LLMs utilized for\nfine-tuning research: LLaMa 2 7B, and Mistral 7B. QLoRA and RAFT are applied to\nthe two pretrained models. The inferences from these models are extensively\nevaluated against the aforementioned metrics.

This paper presents a comprehensive\nreview of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions:\nwhat to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide\nan overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general\nnatural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics,\neducations, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas.\nSecondly, we answer the `where' and `how' questions by diving into the\nevaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in\nassessing performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases\nof LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges\nthat lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to\nresearchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of\nmore proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an\nessential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently\nmaintain the related open-source materials at:\nhttps://github.com/MLGroupJLU/LLM-eval-survey.",

Among them, academia is not simply a domain\naffected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs.\nIn academic publications, this phenomenon is represented during the\nincorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts.\nWe proposed the concept of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) in our\nprevious paper. As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase\nof ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold\ntransformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they\nalso pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey\npaper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin\nwith a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review\nwhat ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the\nincorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods,\nnew datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for\nASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and\ninvestigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR.\nLastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for\nASPR. We hope this survey can serve as an inspirational reference for the\nresearchers and promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.",

It poses a significant challenge to develop\ncapable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major\napproach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding\nand generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language\nmodels to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)\nhave been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora,\nshowing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers\nhave found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further\nstudy the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size.\nInterestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged\nlanguage models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also\nshow some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language\nmodels. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research\ncommunity has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of\nsignificant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by\nboth academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT,\nwhich has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution\nof LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which\nwould revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this\nsurvey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background,\nkey findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major\naspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and\ncapacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for\ndeveloping LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.",

Firstly, LLMs sometimes generate\nanswers that rely on internal memory rather than retrieving evidence and\nreasoning in the given context, which brings concerns about the evaluation\nquality of real reasoning abilities. Although previous counterfactual QA\nbenchmarks can separate the internal memory of LLMs, they focus solely on final\nQA performance, which is insufficient for reporting LLMs' real reasoning\nabilities. Because LLMs are expected to engage in intricate reasoning processes\nthat involve evidence retrieval and answering a series of sub-questions from\ngiven passages. Moreover, current factual Multi-hop QA (MHQA) benchmarks are\nannotated on open-source corpora such as Wikipedia, although useful for\nmulti-step reasoning evaluation, they show limitations due to the potential\ndata contamination in LLMs' pre-training stage. To address these issues, we\nintroduce a Step-wise Counterfactual benchmark (CofCA), a novel evaluation\nbenchmark consisting of factual data and counterfactual data that reveals LLMs'\nreal reasoning abilities on multi-step reasoning and reasoning chain\nevaluation. Our experimental results reveal a significant performance gap of\nseveral LLMs between Wikipedia-based factual data and counterfactual data,\ndeeming data contamination issues in existing benchmarks.

Therefore, refined\nmethods to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs are needed to determine the tasks\nand responsibility they should undertake. Our study mainly discussed how LLMs,\nas useful tools, should be effectively assessed. We proposed the two-stage\nframework: from ``core ability'' to ``agent'', clearly explaining how LLMs can\nbe applied based on their specific capabilities, along with the evaluation\nmethods in each stage. Core ability refers to the capabilities that LLMs need\nin order to generate high-quality natural language texts. After confirming LLMs\npossess core ability, they can solve real-world and complex tasks as agent. In\nthe \"core ability\" stage, we discussed the reasoning ability, societal impact,\nand domain knowledge of LLMs. In the ``agent'' stage, we demonstrated embodied\naction, planning, and tool learning of LLMs agent applications. Finally, we\nexamined the challenges currently confronting the evaluation methods for LLMs,\nas well as the directions for future development.",

Firstly, LLMs sometimes generate\nanswers that rely on internal memory rather than retrieving evidence and\nreasoning in the given context, which brings concerns about the evaluation\nquality of real reasoning abilities. Although previous counterfactual QA\nbenchmarks can separate the internal memory of LLMs, they focus solely on final\nQA performance, which is insufficient for reporting LLMs' real reasoning\nabilities. Because LLMs are expected to engage in intricate reasoning processes\nthat involve evidence retrieval and answering a series of sub-questions from\ngiven passages. Moreover, current factual Multi-hop QA (MHQA) benchmarks are\nannotated on open-source corpora such as Wikipedia, although useful for\nmulti-step reasoning evaluation, they show limitations due to the potential\ndata contamination in LLMs' pre-training stage. To address these issues, we\nintroduce a Step-wise Counterfactual benchmark (CofCA), a novel evaluation\nbenchmark consisting of factual data and counterfactual data that reveals LLMs'\nreal reasoning abilities on multi-step reasoning and reasoning chain\nevaluation. Our experimental results reveal a significant performance gap of\nseveral LLMs between Wikipedia-based factual data and counterfactual data,\ndeeming data contamination issues in existing benchmarks.

However, current\nbenchmarks are often simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well and\nmaking it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks\ntypically rely on static question-answer pairs that the models might memorize\nor guess. To address these limitations, we introduce Dynamic Intelligence\nAssessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic\nquestion templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as\nmathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The\naccompanying dataset, DIA-Bench, contains a diverse collection of challenge\ntemplates with mutable parameters presented in various formats, including text,\nPDFs, compiled binaries, visual puzzles, and CTF-style cybersecurity\nchallenges. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's\nreliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed\nthat even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in\nvarying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably,\nAPI models like GPT-4o often overestimated their mathematical capabilities,\nwhile ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better performance due to effective tool usage.\nIn self-assessment, OpenAI's o1-mini proved to have the best judgement on what\ntasks it should attempt to solve. We evaluated 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using\nDIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often\ndisplay unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions.

Its relevance to language understanding and knowledge\nretrieval tasks, along with the simple setting makes the task of QA crucial for\nstrong AI systems. Recent success on simple QA tasks has shifted the focus to\nmore complex settings. Among these, Multi-Hop QA (MHQA) is one of the most\nresearched tasks over the recent years. In broad terms, MHQA is the task of\nanswering natural language questions that involve extracting and combining\nmultiple pieces of information and doing multiple steps of reasoning. An\nexample of a multi-hop question would be \"The Argentine PGA Championship record\nholder has won how many tournaments worldwide?\". Answering the question would\nneed two pieces of information: \"Who is the record holder for Argentine PGA\nChampionship tournaments?\" and \"How many tournaments did [Answer of Sub Q1]\nwin?\". The ability to answer multi-hop questions and perform multi step\nreasoning can significantly improve the utility of NLP systems. Consequently,\nthe field has seen a surge with high quality datasets, models and evaluation\nstrategies. The notion of 'multiple hops' is somewhat abstract which results in\na large variety of tasks that require multi-hop reasoning. This leads to\ndifferent datasets and models that differ significantly from each other and\nmakes the field challenging to generalize and survey. We aim to provide a\ngeneral and formal definition of the MHQA task, and organize and summarize\nexisting MHQA frameworks. We also outline some best practices for building MHQA\ndatasets. This book provides a systematic and thorough introduction as well as\nthe structuring of the existing attempts to this highly interesting, yet quite\nchallenging task.",

In this paper, we investigate the limitations of LMMs in\ngenerating long captions for long videos. Our analysis reveals that open-source\nLMMs struggle to consistently produce outputs exceeding 300 words, leading to\nincomplete or overly concise descriptions of the visual content. This\nlimitation hinders the ability of LMMs to provide comprehensive and detailed\ncaptions for long videos, ultimately missing important visual information.\nThrough controlled experiments, we find that the scarcity of paired examples\nwith long-captions during training is the primary factor limiting the model's\noutput length. However, manually annotating long-caption examples for long-form\nvideos is time-consuming and expensive. To overcome the annotation bottleneck,\nwe propose the LongCaption-Agent, a framework that synthesizes long caption\ndata by hierarchical semantic aggregation. % aggregating multi-level\ndescriptions. Using LongCaption-Agent, we curated a new long-caption dataset,\nLongCaption-10K.

The increased number of frames in long videos poses two\nmain challenges: difficulty in locating key information and performing\nlong-range reasoning. Thus, we propose DrVideo, a document-retrieval-based\nsystem designed for long video understanding. Our key idea is to convert the\nlong-video understanding problem into a long-document understanding task so as\nto effectively leverage the power of large language models. Specifically,\nDrVideo first transforms a long video into a coarse text-based long document to\ninitially retrieve key frames and then updates the documents with the augmented\nkey frame information.

To tackle the challenge, we propose a new video summarization\nframework that leverages the capabilities of recent Large Language Models\n(LLMs), expecting that the knowledge learned from massive data enables LLMs to\nevaluate video frames in a manner that better aligns with diverse semantics and\nhuman judgments, effectively addressing the inherent subjectivity in defining\nkeyframes.

These local importance scores are\nrefined through a global attention mechanism in the entire context of video\ncaptions, ensuring that our summaries effectively reflect both the details and\nthe overarching narrative.

Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a\nnotable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the\neffective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs).\nAdditionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video\nsummarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content\nsummarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to\nmultimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks\nbased on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and\na combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual\nsummaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these\nissues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset\nfeaturing 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from\n40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video\nsummary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references\nspecific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and\ntextual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework\nnamed V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the\nfirst framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large\nlanguage model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video\nsummarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show\nthat V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video\nsummarization tasks.

YouTube in particular was previously synonymous with being the\nmain hub for long form video content consumption. The monetization of long form\nvideos was easier as it allowed multiple advertisement placements during the\ncourse of the video. This model also facilitated thematic brand partnerships.\nHowever, since the introduction of short form content, creators have found it\nmore difficult to generate revenue as advertisement placements have decreased.\nThis leads to a unique situation where people are spending more time watching\nshorter videos, and yet they generate less revenue for the creators. In this\npaper, we perform a study of 250 creators with significant audiences to see if\nthe introduction of short form content has affected the view counts and\nengagement of long form content. Our findings reveal a noteworthy trend: since\nthe advent of short-form content, there has been a significant decrease in both\nview counts and engagement in long-form videos on these channels.",

In the\nsecond stage, we propose an adaptive frame selection mechanism guided by the\nmemory content to identify instruction-relevant key moments. It enriches the\nmemory representations with detailed spatial information by selecting a few\nhigh-resolution frames, which are then combined with the memory contents and\nfed into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the final answer.

            "abstract": "In recent years, 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant\nstrides in image-text understanding tasks. However, their performance in 3D\nspatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains\nlimited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images\nas inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely\nvision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on\nvisual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates\nthe limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary\nshortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene\nand individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual\nprompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the\nglobal-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding\nof indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nimage from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the\nBEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames\nwith markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over\nclosed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video\ndataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks.\nSurprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently\nimprove during inference, even without object marker prompting and BEV image as\nexplicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs\ndevelop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a\nseamless approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.",

Their full power is better harnessed when the models are coupled\nwith external verifiers and the final solutions are derived iteratively or\nprogressively according to the verification feedback. In the context of\nembodied AI, verification often solely involves assessing whether goal\nconditions specified in the instructions have been met. Nonetheless, for these\nagents to be seamlessly integrated into daily life, it is crucial to account\nfor a broader range of constraints and preferences beyond bare task success\n(e.g., a robot should grasp bread with care to avoid significant deformations).\nHowever, given the unbounded scope of robot tasks, it is infeasible to\nconstruct scripted verifiers akin to those used for explicit-knowledge tasks\nlike the game of Go and theorem proving. This begs the question: when no sound\nverifier is available, can we use large vision and language models (VLMs),\nwhich are approximately omniscient, as scalable Behavior Critics to catch\nundesirable robot behaviors in videos? To answer this, we first construct a\nbenchmark that contains diverse cases of goal-reaching yet undesirable robot\npolicies. Then, we comprehensively evaluate VLM critics to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of their strengths and failure modes.

To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video\ncontent, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the\nraw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the\nediting components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models\nmust process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong\nbackground knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw\nvideos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this\nreport, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a\nwide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on\ntemporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos\ncorresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent\nediting. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong\ntemporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain\nqueries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also\npresent the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video\nduration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival\ndatasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format:\ndiverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges\nare manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support\nevaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly\noutperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the\ntemporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.",

To address this limitation, we propose\nTemporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework\ndesigned to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through\npreference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to\ndifferentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by\nleveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal\ngrounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal\ngrounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video\nsequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly\nenhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated\ndata. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding\nbenchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness\nof TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO\nestablishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark,\nunderscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for\nadvancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

To\naddress this, we construct a large-scale multimodal prompt dataset by employing\nretrieval methods to pair in-context examples with the given text prompts and\nthen utilize a two-stage training strategy to enable diverse video generation\ntasks within the same model. In the first stage, we propose a multimodal\nconditional video generation framework for pretraining on these augmented\ndatasets, establishing a foundational model for grounded video generation.\nSecondly, we finetune the model from the first stage on three video generation\ntasks, incorporating multi-modal instructions. This process further refines the\nmodel's ability to handle diverse inputs and tasks, ensuring seamless\nintegration of multi-modal information. After this two-stage train-ing process,\nVIMI demonstrates multimodal understanding capabilities, producing contextually\nrich and personalized videos grounded in the provided inputs, as shown in\nFigure 1.

However, RLHF is susceptible to\nreward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather\nthan learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward\nshaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a\nsystematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying\nprinciples remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive\nstudy of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key\ndesign principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid\ninitial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best\nformulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we\npropose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent\npreferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for\nreinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and\nLlama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF.\nExperimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward\nshaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at\nleast 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR\nexhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward\nfor optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even\nafter two full epochs of training.

We investigate three types of agents: (i) RL-based agents that\nutilize natural language for state and action representations to find the best\ninteraction strategy, (ii) LLM-based agents that leverage the model's general\nknowledge and reasoning through prompting, and (iii) hybrid LLM-assisted RL\nagents that combine these two strategies to improve agents' performance and\ngeneralization. To support the development and evaluation of these agents, we\nintroduce PharmaSimText, a novel benchmark derived from the PharmaSim virtual\npharmacy environment designed for practicing diagnostic conversations. Our\nresults show that RL-based agents excel in task completion but lack in asking\nquality diagnostic questions. In contrast, LLM-based agents perform better in\nasking diagnostic questions but fall short of completing the task.

However, RLHF is susceptible to\nreward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather\nthan learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward\nshaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a\nsystematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying\nprinciples remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive\nstudy of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key\ndesign principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid\ninitial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best\nformulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we\npropose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent\npreferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for\nreinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and\nLlama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF.\nExperimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward\nshaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at\nleast 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR\nexhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward\nfor optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even\nafter two full epochs of training.

Recent advances by proprietary\ncompanies, such as o-series models of OpenAI, have made remarkable progress on\nreasoning tasks. However, the complete technical details remain unrevealed, and\nthe techniques that are believed certainly to be adopted are only reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and the long chain of thoughts.

We theoretically prove that behavior cloning on\npositive trajectories from best-of-N (BoN) sampling is sufficient to learn the\nKL-regularized optimal policy in binary feedback environments. This formulation\nfurther implies that the rewards of negative samples should be reshaped to\nensure the gradient consistency between positive and negative samples. To\nalleviate the long-existing difficulties brought by sparse rewards in RL, which\nare even exacerbated by the partial correctness of the long chain of thought\nfor reasoning tasks, we further apply a token-level reward model to sample\nimportant tokens in reasoning trajectories for learning. With OREAL, for the\nfirst time, a 7B model can obtain 94.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500 through RL,\nbeing on par with 32B models. OREAL-32B also surpasses previous 32B models\ntrained by distillation with 95.0 pass@1 accuracy on MATH-500.

However, as base LLM\nmodels continue to improve, acquiring meaningful human feedback has become\nincreasingly challenging and costly. In certain domains, base LLM agents may\neventually exceed human capabilities, making traditional feedback-driven\nmethods impractical. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-improvement\nparadigm that empowers LLM agents to autonomously enhance their performance\nwithout external human feedback. Our method, Juxtaposed Outcomes for Simulation\nHarvesting (JOSH), is a self-alignment algorithm that leverages a sparse reward\nsimulation environment to extract ideal behaviors and further train the LLM on\nits own outputs. We present ToolWOZ, a sparse reward tool-calling simulation\nenvironment derived from MultiWOZ. We demonstrate that models trained with\nJOSH, both small and frontier, significantly improve tool-based interactions\nwhile preserving general model capabilities across diverse benchmarks.

However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

However, RLHF is susceptible to\nreward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather\nthan learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward\nshaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a\nsystematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying\nprinciples remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive\nstudy of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key\ndesign principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid\ninitial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best\nformulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we\npropose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent\npreferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for\nreinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and\nLlama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF.\nExperimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward\nshaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at\nleast 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR\nexhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward\nfor optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even\nafter two full epochs of training.

To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied\napproach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to\nan optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function\nfor all desirable states in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) is challenging,\neven for domain experts. Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a magnitude of natural language\ntasks, we aim to answer the following question: `Can we obtain heuristics using\nLLMs for constructing a reward shaping function that can boost an RL agent's\nsample efficiency?' To this end, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to\ngenerate a plan for an abstraction of the underlying MDP. We further use this\nLLM-generated plan as a heuristic to construct the reward shaping signal for\nthe downstream RL agent. By characterizing the type of abstraction based on the\nMDP horizon length, we analyze the quality of heuristics when generated using\nan LLM, with and without a verifier in the loop. Our experiments across\nmultiple domains with varying horizon length and number of sub-goals from the\nBabyAI environment suite, Household, Mario, and, Minecraft domain, show 1) the\nadvantages and limitations of querying LLMs with and without a verifier to\ngenerate a reward shaping heuristic, and, 2) a significant improvement in the\nsample efficiency of PPO, A2C, and Q-learning when guided by the LLM-generated\nheuristics.",

Traditional search\nevaluation methods primarily rely on relevance labels, which assess how well\nretrieved documents match a user's query. However, relevance alone fails to\ncapture a search system's effectiveness in helping users achieve their search\ngoals, making usefulness a critical evaluation criterion. In this paper, we\nexplore an alternative approach: LLM-generated usefulness labels, which\nincorporate both implicit and explicit user behavior signals to evaluate\ndocument usefulness. We propose Task-aware Rubric-based Usefulness Evaluation\n(TRUE), a rubric-driven evaluation method that employs iterative sampling and\nreasoning to model complex search behavior patterns. Our findings show that (i)\nLLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by leveraging comprehensive search\nsession history incorporating personalization and contextual understanding, and\n(ii) fine-tuned LLMs improve usefulness judgments when provided with structured\nsearch session contexts. Additionally, we examine whether LLMs can distinguish\nbetween relevance and usefulness, particularly in cases where this divergence\nimpacts search success. We also conduct an ablation study to identify key\nmetrics for accurate usefulness label generation, optimizing for token\nefficiency and cost-effectiveness in real-world applications.

First, we analyze how learning\ncan enhance search efficiency and propose Search via Learning (SeaL), a\nframework that leverages LLMs for effective and efficient search. Second, we\nfurther extend SeaL to SeaL-C to ensure rigorous completeness during search.\nOur evaluation across three real-world planning tasks demonstrates that SeaL\nachieves near-perfect accuracy while reducing search spaces by up to 99.1%\ncompared to traditional approaches. Finally, we explore how far LLMs are from\nreal search by investigating whether they can develop search capabilities\nindependently. Our analysis reveals that while current LLMs struggle with\nefficient search in complex problems, incorporating systematic search\nstrategies significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities.

Concretely, a Query-Instructed Adapter (QIA) module is\ndesigned to derive the user/item representation vectors by incorporating their\nheterogeneous features. A feature adaptation step is further introduced to\nalign the semantics of user/item representations with the LLM. Finally, the\nLLM4PR integrates a learning to post-rank step, leveraging both a main task and\nan auxiliary task to fine-tune the model to adapt the post-ranking task.\nExperiment studies demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to significant\nimprovements and exhibits state-of-the-art performance compared with other\nalternatives.",

The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its\norigins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models.\nWhile the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and\nsemantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face\nchallenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of\ncontextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution\nrequires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse\nretrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as\nlanguage models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the\nemergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has\nrevolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language\nunderstanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities.\nConsequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR\nsystems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary\nto consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a\ncomprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs\nand IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers,\nrerankers, and readers. Additionally, we explore promising directions, such as\nsearch agents, within this expanding field.",

            "abstract": "Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a\nsearcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems. The best way to\ncapture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback\non which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a\nlarge number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with\nthird-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of\nlow-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve\nquality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user\nstudies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically\ndisagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging\nguidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate\napproach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real\nusers, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that\ncan be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with\nthat data.\n  We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for\nlarge-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We\nhave found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as\nhuman labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs,\nand best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in\naccuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real\nsearchers needs high-quality \"gold\" labels, but with these we find that models\nproduce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and\nthese labels let us train notably better rankers.",

To address these limitations, we propose a\ntoolkit that operates on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) principles,\nspecialized prompting and instructing techniques with the help of LLMs. Our\nsystem first initiates a web search to retrieve relevant papers by summarizing\nuser-provided abstracts into keywords using an off-the-shelf LLM.

This paper explores the zero-shot abilities\nof recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of\nliterature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two\ncomponents: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing\na literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective\nLLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step\nsearch strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the\nabstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying\nan external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking\nmechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized\nrecall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the\nLLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step\napproach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in\nthe plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based\nliterature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a\nprotocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set\ncontamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to\npromote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical\nresults suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature\nreviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and\nplanning.

While previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using\nuser behavior signals (e.g., clicks) as both features and labels of LTR\nalgorithms, we argue that existing LTR algorithms that indiscriminately treat\nbehavior and non-behavior signals in input features could lead to suboptimal\nperformance in practice. Particularly because user behavior signals often have\nstrong correlations with the ranking objective and can only be collected on\nitems that have already been shown to users, directly using behavior signals in\nLTR could create an exploitation bias that hurts the system performance in the\nlong run.\n  To address the exploitation bias, we propose EBRank, an empirical Bayes-based\nuncertainty-aware ranking algorithm. Specifically, to overcome exploitation\nbias brought by behavior features in ranking models, EBRank uses a sole\nnon-behavior feature based prior model to get a prior estimation of relevance.\nIn the dynamic training and serving of ranking systems, EBRank uses the\nobserved user behaviors to update posterior relevance estimation instead of\nconcatenating behaviors as features in ranking models. Besides, EBRank\nadditionally applies an uncertainty-aware exploration strategy to explore\nactively, collect user behaviors for empirical Bayesian modeling and improve\nranking performance.

Besides the\nranking relevance to users, the exposure fairness to item providers has also\nbeen considered an important factor in ranking optimization. Many fair ranking\nalgorithms have been proposed to jointly optimize both ranking relevance and\nfairness. However, we find that most existing fair ranking methods adopt greedy\nalgorithms that only optimize rankings for the next immediate session or\nrequest. As shown in this paper, such a myopic paradigm could limit the upper\nbound of ranking optimization and lead to suboptimal performance in the long\nterm.\n  To this end, we propose \\textbf{FARA}, a novel \\textbf{F}uture-\\textbf{A}ware\n\\textbf{R}anking \\textbf{A}lgorithm for ranking relevance and fairness\noptimization. Instead of greedily optimizing rankings for the next immediate\nsession, FARA plans ahead by jointly optimizing multiple ranklists together and\nsaving them for future sessions. Specifically, FARA first uses the Taylor\nexpansion to investigate how future ranklists will influence the overall\nfairness of the system. Then, based on the analysis of the Taylor expansion,\nFARA adopts a two-phase optimization algorithm where we first solve an optimal\nfuture exposure planning problem and then construct the optimal ranklists\naccording to the optimal future exposure planning. Theoretically, we show that\nFARA is optimal for ranking relevance and fairness joint optimization.\nEmpirically, our extensive experiments on three semi-synthesized datasets show\nthat FARA is efficient, effective, and can deliver significantly better ranking\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art fair ranking methods.

Our research addresses the\nchallenge of adaptively ranking items from a candidate pool for heterogeneous\nusers, a key component in personalizing user experience. We develop a user\nresponse model that considers diverse user preferences and the varying effects\nof item positions, aiming to optimize overall user satisfaction with the ranked\nlist. We frame this problem within a contextual bandits framework, with each\nranked list as an action. Our approach incorporates an upper confidence bound\nto adjust predicted user satisfaction scores and selects the ranking action\nthat maximizes these adjusted scores, efficiently solved via maximum weight\nimperfect matching. We demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a cumulative\nregret bound of $O(d\\sqrt{NKT})$ for ranking $K$ out of $N$ items in a\n$d$-dimensional context space over $T$ rounds, under the assumption that user\nresponses follow a generalized linear model. This regret alleviates dependence\non the ambient action space, whose cardinality grows exponentially with $N$ and\n$K$ (thus rendering direct application of existing adaptive learning algorithms\n-- such as UCB or Thompson sampling -- infeasible). Experiments conducted on\nboth simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate our algorithm outperforms\nthe baseline.",

This paper conducts an in-depth\nexamination of how integrating LLMs with search engines can mutually benefit\nboth technologies. We focus on two main areas: using search engines to improve\nLLMs (Search4LLM) and enhancing search engine functions using LLMs\n(LLM4Search). For Search4LLM, we investigate how search engines can provide\ndiverse high-quality datasets for pre-training of LLMs, how they can use the\nmost relevant documents to help LLMs learn to answer queries more accurately,\nhow training LLMs with Learning-To-Rank (LTR) tasks can enhance their ability\nto respond with greater precision, and how incorporating recent search results\ncan make LLM-generated content more accurate and current. In terms of\nLLM4Search, we examine how LLMs can be used to summarize content for better\nindexing by search engines, improve query outcomes through optimization,\nenhance the ranking of search results by analyzing document relevance, and help\nin annotating data for learning-to-rank tasks in various learning contexts.\nHowever, this promising integration comes with its challenges, which include\naddressing potential biases and ethical issues in training models, managing the\ncomputational and other costs of incorporating LLMs into search services, and\ncontinuously updating LLM training with the ever-changing web content. We\ndiscuss these challenges and chart out required research directions to address\nthem.

The best way to\ncapture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback\non which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a\nlarge number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with\nthird-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of\nlow-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve\nquality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user\nstudies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically\ndisagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging\nguidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate\napproach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real\nusers, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that\ncan be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with\nthat data.\n  We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for\nlarge-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We\nhave found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as\nhuman labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs,\nand best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in\naccuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real\nsearchers needs high-quality \"gold\" labels, but with these we find that models\nproduce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and\nthese labels let us train notably better rankers.",

We argue that this\nscaling law relationship depends on metrics used to measure performance that\nmay not correspond with how different groups of people perceive the quality of\nmodels' output. As the size of datasets used to train large AI models grows and\nAI systems impact ever larger groups of people, the number of distinct\ncommunities represented in training or evaluation datasets grows. It is thus\neven more likely that communities represented in datasets may have values or\npreferences not reflected in (or at odds with) the metrics used to evaluate\nmodel performance in scaling laws.

We end the paper with\nimplications for AI development: that the motivation for scraping ever-larger\ndatasets may be based on fundamentally flawed assumptions about model\nperformance.

In this\nwork, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching\nproblem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target\nvideo distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time\nverifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching\nprocess. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search\nstrategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step\ndenoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs,\nwe further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called\nTree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an\nautoregressive manner.

A key hurdle for building such\ngeneral models is the diversity and heterogeneity of tasks and modalities. A\npromising solution is unification, allowing the support of a myriad of tasks\nand modalities within one unified framework. While few large models (e.g.,\nFlamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), trained on massive datasets, can support more\nthan two modalities, current small to mid-scale unified models are still\nlimited to 2 modalities, usually image-text or video-text. The question that we\nask is: is it possible to build efficiently a unified model that can support\nall modalities? To answer this, we propose UnIVAL, a step further towards this\nambitious goal. Without relying on fancy datasets sizes or models with billions\nof parameters, the ~ 0.25B parameter UnIVAL model goes beyond two modalities\nand unifies text, images, video, and audio into a single model. Our model is\nefficiently pretrained on many tasks, based on task balancing and multimodal\ncurriculum learning. UnIVAL shows competitive performance to existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches, across image and video-text tasks. The feature\nrepresentations learned from image and video-text modalities, allows the model\nto achieve competitive performance when finetuned on audio-text tasks, despite\nnot being pretrained on audio. Thanks to the unified model, we propose a novel\nstudy on multimodal model merging via weight interpolation of models trained on\ndifferent multimodal tasks, showing their benefits in particular for\nout-of-distribution generalization. Finally, we motivate unification by showing\nthe synergy between tasks. The model weights and code are released here:\nhttps://github.com/mshukor/UnIVAL.",

We propose an effective multi-modal training schema that starts with\nlarge language models and proceeds through vision-language alignment, general\nknowledge learning, and two sequential stages of long-sequence fine-tuning. We\nfurther implement context-parallelism distributed inference and logits-masked\nlanguage modeling head to scale Long-VITA to infinitely long inputs of images\nand texts during model inference. Regarding training data, Long-VITA is built\non a mix of 17M samples from public datasets only and demonstrates the\nstate-of-the-art performance on various multi-modal benchmarks, compared\nagainst recent cutting-edge models with internal data. Long-VITA is fully\nreproducible and supports both NPU and GPU platforms for training and testing.\nBy leveraging our inference designs, Long-VITA models achieve a remarkable 2x\nprefill speedup and 4x context length extension in single node with 8 GPUs. We\nhope Long-VITA can serve as a competitive baseline and offer valuable insights\nfor the open-source community in advancing long-context multi-modal\nunderstanding.",

As such, one natural question arises: Is it possible to have a\nunified model for both understanding and generation? To answer this question,\nin this paper, we first provide a detailed review of both MLLM and diffusion\nmodels, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal\narchitecture design, and advanced applications to image/video large language\nmodels as well as text-to-image/video generation.

A substantial amount of\nattention has been dedicated as a consequence to the description of scaling\nlaws, although mostly for supervised learning and only to a reduced extent for\nreinforcement learning frameworks. In this paper we present an extensive study\nof performance scaling for a cornerstone reinforcement learning algorithm,\nAlphaZero. On the basis of a relationship between Elo rating, playing strength\nand power-law scaling, we train AlphaZero agents on the games Connect Four and\nPentago and analyze their performance. We find that player strength scales as a\npower law in neural network parameter count when not bottlenecked by available\ncompute, and as a power of compute when training optimally sized agents. We\nobserve nearly identical scaling exponents for both games. Combining the two\nobserved scaling laws we obtain a power law relating optimal size to compute\nsimilar to the ones observed for language models. We find that the predicted\nscaling of optimal neural network size fits our data for both games. This\nscaling law implies that previously published state-of-the-art game-playing\nmodels are significantly smaller than their optimal size, given the respective\ncompute budgets. We also show that large AlphaZero models are more sample\nefficient, performing better than smaller models with the same amount of\ntraining data.",

Due to the difficulties\nin collecting high-quality 3D data, research in this area has only recently\ngained momentum. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs),\nmulti-modal LLMs for 3D vision have been developed over the past few years.\nHowever, most of these models focus primarily on the vision encoder for 3D\ndata. In this paper, we propose converting existing densely activated LLMs into\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which have proven effective for multi-modal\ndata processing. In addition to leveraging these models' instruction-following\ncapabilities, we further enable embodied task planning by attaching a diffusion\nhead, Pose-DiT, that employs a novel rectified flow diffusion scheduler.\nExperimental results on 3D question answering and task-planning tasks\ndemonstrate that our 3D-MoE framework achieves improved performance with fewer\nactivated parameters.",

These large models, leveraging their extensive\ntraining data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream\ntasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the\ndevelopment of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous\nconsumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the\ndifficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the\nusability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted\nmuch attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and\nactivating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been\nshown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with\nfewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal\ndata. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various\ndomains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements\nof MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their\nlimitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas,\nand we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic\ndesign of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms,\ntraining strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of\nMoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning,\nmeta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally,\nwe summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its\napplications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we\ndiscuss promising future research directions.",

Extensive experiments show the significant\nperformance of MoE-LLaVA in a variety of visual understanding and object\nhallucination benchmarks. Remarkably, with only approximately 3B sparsely\nactivated parameters, MoE-LLaVA demonstrates performance comparable to the\nLLaVA-1.5-7B on various visual understanding datasets and even surpasses the\nLLaVA-1.5-13B in object hallucination benchmark.

Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to\nproduce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with advancements in VLMs,\nefforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain\nand to introduce descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM\ntraining. This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM\nspecifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE\nmodels, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel\nInstruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as\nexpert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts\ntailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects\nof the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on\na specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy\nof the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by\nfacilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a\ntwo-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance\ndegradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset\nusing our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap\ndataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no\nadditional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant\ncaptions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B\nVLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design. Moreover, our model\ndemonstrates promising generalization capabilities by consistently achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering\n(RSVQA) task.",

This survey seeks to bridge that gap, serving as an essential resource\nfor researchers delving into the intricacies of MoE. We first briefly introduce\nthe structure of the MoE layer, followed by proposing a new taxonomy of MoE.\nNext, we overview the core designs for various MoE models including both\nalgorithmic and systemic aspects, alongside collections of available\nopen-source implementations, hyperparameter configurations and empirical\nevaluations. Furthermore, we delineate the multifaceted applications of MoE in\npractice, and outline some potential directions for future research.

Notably,\nthe emerging Mamba-2 has demonstrated competitive performance, bridging the gap\nbetween RNN models and transformers. However, due to sequential processing and\nvanishing gradients, RNN models struggle to capture long-range dependencies,\nlimiting contextual understanding. This results in slow convergence, high\nresource demands, and poor performance on downstream understanding and complex\nreasoning tasks. In this work, we present a hybrid model MaTVLM by substituting\na portion of the transformer decoder layers in a pre-trained VLM with Mamba-2\nlayers. Leveraging the inherent relationship between attention and Mamba-2, we\ninitialize Mamba-2 with corresponding attention weights to accelerate\nconvergence. Subsequently, we employ a single-stage distillation process, using\nthe pre-trained VLM as the teacher model to transfer knowledge to the MaTVLM,\nfurther enhancing convergence speed and performance. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the impact of differential distillation loss within our training\nframework. We evaluate the MaTVLM on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating\ncompetitive performance against the teacher model and existing VLMs while\nsurpassing both Mamba-based VLMs and models of comparable parameter scales.\nRemarkably, the MaTVLM achieves up to 3.6x faster inference than the teacher\nmodel while reducing GPU memory consumption by 27.5%, all without compromising\nperformance.

However,\nboth approaches present inherent limitations, forcing a trade-off between data\nand computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce the\nData-$\\textbf{E}$fficient and Compute-$\\textbf{E}$fficient $\\textbf{MLLM}$\n($\\textbf{EE-MLLM}$). Specifically, we modify the original self-attention\nmechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism.

As a result,\nEE-MLLM significantly outperforms Flamingo with limited training data, and\nreduces the prefilling time to 79 ms on an H800 GPU, compared to LLaVA's 277\nms. To further investigate the efficiency of EE-MLLM, we present a\ntraining-free variant named EE-MLLM-F, which reduces the computation cost of\nself-attention-based method without additional training.

Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to\nproduce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with advancements in VLMs,\nefforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain\nand to introduce descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM\ntraining. This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM\nspecifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE\nmodels, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel\nInstruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as\nexpert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts\ntailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects\nof the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on\na specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy\nof the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by\nfacilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a\ntwo-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance\ndegradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset\nusing our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap\ndataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no\nadditional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant\ncaptions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B\nVLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design. Moreover, our model\ndemonstrates promising generalization capabilities by consistently achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering\n(RSVQA) task.",

Astrea introduces three key innovations: 1) A heterogeneous\nexpert coordination mechanism that integrates four specialized models\n(detection, segmentation, classification, captioning) into a comprehensive\nexpert matrix covering essential visual comprehension elements; 2) A dynamic\nknowledge fusion strategy featuring progressive pre-alignment to harmonize\nexperts within the VLM latent space through contrastive learning, complemented\nby probabilistically activated stochastic residual connections to preserve\nknowledge continuity; 3) An enhanced optimization framework utilizing momentum\ncontrastive learning for long-range dependency modeling and adaptive weight\nallocators for real-time expert contribution calibration. Extensive evaluations\nacross 12 benchmark tasks spanning VQA, image captioning, and cross-modal\nretrieval demonstrate Astrea's superiority over state-of-the-art models,\nachieving an average performance gain of +4.7\\%. This study provides the first\nempirical demonstration that progressive pre-alignment strategies enable VLMs\nto overcome task heterogeneity limitations, establishing new methodological\nfoundations for developing general-purpose multimodal agents.",

In this work, we present a systematic and thorough\nreview of more than 100 transformers methods for different 3D vision tasks,\nincluding classification, segmentation, detection, completion, pose estimation,\nand others. We discuss transformer design in 3D vision, which allows it to\nprocess data with various 3D representations. For each application, we\nhighlight key properties and contributions of proposed transformer-based\nmethods. To assess the competitiveness of these methods, we compare their\nperformance to common non-transformer methods on 12 3D benchmarks.

In this work, we analyze camera motion from a\nfirst principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera\nmanipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that\nmotion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This\nmotivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating\ntraining convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by\nprobing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we\nobserve that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and\nonly a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This\nsuggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the\narchitecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x\nreduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher\nvisual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control\nlearning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary\ncameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and\nimproves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these\nfindings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture, the new\nstate-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.",

Our approach introduces a\nsimple yet effective temporal kernel to smooth DiT features along the temporal\ndimension, facilitating the decoupling of foreground motion from background\nappearance. Meanwhile, the temporal kernel effectively captures temporal\nvariations in DiT features, which are closely related to motion. Moreover, we\nintroduce explicit supervision along dense trajectories in the latent feature\nspace to further enhance motion consistency. Additionally, we present MTBench,\na general and challenging benchmark for motion transfer. We also introduce a\nhybrid motion fidelity metric that considers both the global and local motion\nsimilarity. Therefore, our work provides a more comprehensive evaluation than\nprevious works. Extensive experiments on MTBench demonstrate that DeT achieves\nthe best trade-off between motion fidelity and edit fidelity.",

Prior research on\nconcept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks.\nComparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasing\ncomplexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. In\nthis work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the first\nVideo Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we propose\nan efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of video\ntransformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to the\noutput of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealing\nspatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in\nunstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse set\nof supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some of\nthese mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we show that VTCD\ncan be used for fine-grained action recognition and video object segmentation.",

These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of\nvision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision\ndiscipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the\nsuccess of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and\nbidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in\nvision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object\ndetection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling,\nmulti-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and\nvisual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video\nforecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image\nenhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud\nclassification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and\nlimitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and\ntheir experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research\ndirections and possible future works.",

This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to\naddress this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in\npretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D\nwindows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA\neliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise\nsliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel\nhardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being\nhardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the\nfirst efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving\n58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over\nFlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading\nvideo DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s\nwithout quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further\nlowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench.",

            "abstract": "Contemporary models for generating images show remarkable quality and\nversatility. Swayed by these advantages, the research community repurposes them\nto generate videos. Since video content is highly redundant, we argue that\nnaively bringing advances of image models to the video generation domain\nreduces motion fidelity, visual quality and impairs scalability. In this work,\nwe build Snap Video, a video-first model that systematically addresses these\nchallenges. To do that, we first extend the EDM framework to take into account\nspatially and temporally redundant pixels and naturally support video\ngeneration. Second, we show that a U-Net - a workhorse behind image generation\n- scales poorly when generating videos, requiring significant computational\noverhead. Hence, we propose a new transformer-based architecture that trains\n3.31 times faster than U-Nets (and is ~4.5 faster at inference). This allows us\nto efficiently train a text-to-video model with billions of parameters for the\nfirst time, reach state-of-the-art results on a number of benchmarks, and\ngenerate videos with substantially higher quality, temporal consistency, and\nmotion complexity. The user studies showed that our model was favored by a\nlarge margin over the most recent methods. See our website at\nhttps://snap-research.github.io/snapvideo/.",

Current algorithms enable accurate\npredictions over short horizons but tend to suffer from temporal\ninconsistencies. When generated content goes out of view and is later\nrevisited, the model invents different content instead. Despite this severe\nlimitation, no established benchmarks on complex data exist for rigorously\nevaluating video generation with long temporal dependencies. In this paper, we\ncurate 3 challenging video datasets with long-range dependencies by rendering\nwalks through 3D scenes of procedural mazes, Minecraft worlds, and indoor\nscans. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of current models and observe\ntheir limitations in temporal consistency. Moreover, we introduce the\nTemporally Consistent Transformer (TECO), a generative model that substantially\nimproves long-term consistency while also reducing sampling time. By\ncompressing its input sequence into fewer embeddings, applying a temporal\ntransformer, and expanding back using a spatial MaskGit, TECO outperforms\nexisting models across many metrics.

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational\ncomplexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this\npaper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that\nleverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference\nefficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified\ninto two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where\nonly spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output,\nand (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different\nframes dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling\nstrategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of\nattention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout\ntransformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x\nand 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively,\nwhile preserving generation quality.

Different from\nexisting schemes, operating exclusively in the compressed video domain and\nexploiting all freely available modalities, i.e., I-frames, and P-frames\n(motion vectors and residuals) offers a compute-efficient alternative. Existing\nmethods approach this task as a naive multi-modality problem, ignoring the\ntemporal correlation and implicit sparsity across P-frames for modeling\nstronger shared representations for videos of the same action, making training\nand generalization easier. By revisiting the high-level design of dominant\nvideo understanding backbones, we increase inference speed by a factor of $56$\nwhile retaining similar performance. For this, we propose a hybrid end-to-end\nframework that factorizes learning across three key concepts to reduce\ninference cost by $330\\times$ versus prior art: First, a specially designed\ndual-encoder scheme with efficient Spiking Temporal Modulators to minimize\nlatency while retaining cross-domain feature aggregation. Second, a unified\ntransformer model to capture inter-modal dependencies using global\nself-attention to enhance I-frame -- P-frame contextual interactions.

This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs\nduring both inference and fine-tuning stages.

Specifically, we\ncollect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial\nand refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs\nduring the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs\nstruggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without\nadditional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their\nperformance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when\ntheir self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and\ndisfavored samples.

We identify intrinsic self-correction can (1)\ncause LLMs to waver both intermedia and final answers and lead to prompt bias\non simple factual questions; (2) introduce human-like cognitive bias on complex\ntasks. In light of our findings, we also provide two simple yet effective\nstrategies for alleviation: question repeating and supervised fine-tuning with\na few samples.

To\naddress these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's\nself-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we\nfirst show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline\nmodel-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling\nself-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT falls\nprey to either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the\ndata-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to behavior collapse,\nwhere learning implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior\nthat is often not effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe\naddresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of\nself-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer\nthe learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective\nat test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt.\nThis regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a\nbase model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to\ncollapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With\nGemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves\nstate-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models'\nself-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on MATH and HumanEval.",

Previous studies have mainly concentrated on\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs,\nparticularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely\nunexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs\nduring both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction\nLearning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated\nself-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without\nrelying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we\ncollect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial\nand refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs\nduring the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs\nstruggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without\nadditional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their\nperformance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when\ntheir self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and\ndisfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a\nrefinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models\nthrough additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses\ndirectly without further refinement.",

Secondly, we test the\ncorrection abilities of LLMs -- separately from mistake finding -- using a\nbacktracking setup that feeds ground truth mistake location information to the\nmodel. We show that this boosts downstream task performance across our 5\nreasoning tasks, indicating that LLMs' correction abilities are robust.\nFinally, we show that it is possible to obtain mistake location information\nwithout ground truth labels or in-domain training data.

However, recent studies suggest that\nthey still face challenges in performing fundamental NLP tasks essential for\ndeep language understanding, particularly syntactic parsing. In this paper, we\nconduct an in-depth analysis of LLM parsing capabilities, delving into the\nspecific shortcomings of their parsing results. We find that LLMs may stem from\nlimitations to fully leverage grammar rules in existing treebanks, which\nrestricts their capability to generate valid syntactic structures. To help LLMs\nacquire knowledge without additional training, we propose a self-correction\nmethod that leverages grammar rules from existing treebanks to guide LLMs in\ncorrecting previous errors. Specifically, we automatically detect potential\nerrors and dynamically search for relevant rules, offering hints and examples\nto guide LLMs in making corrections themselves. Experimental results on three\ndatasets with various LLMs, demonstrate that our method significantly improves\nperformance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings on the English and\nChinese datasets.",

To address these, studies prefixed with \"Self-\" such as\nSelf-Consistency, Self-Improve, and Self-Refine have been initiated.

Nonetheless,\nthese efforts lack a unified perspective on summarization, as existing surveys\npredominantly focus on categorization.\n  In this paper, we use a unified perspective of internal consistency, offering\nexplanations for reasoning deficiencies and hallucinations. Internal\nconsistency refers to the consistency in expressions among LLMs' latent,\ndecoding, or response layers based on sampling methodologies. Then, we\nintroduce an effective theoretical framework capable of mining internal\nconsistency, named Self-Feedback. This framework consists of two modules:\nSelf-Evaluation and Self-Update.

This paper experimentally compares different knowledge\ngeneration and self-refinement strategies for LLM-based column type annotation.\nThe strategies include using LLMs to generate term definitions, error-based\nrefinement of term definitions, self-correction, and fine-tuning using examples\nand term definitions. We evaluate these strategies along two dimensions:\neffectiveness measured as F1 performance and efficiency measured in terms of\ntoken usage and cost. Our experiments show that the best performing strategy\ndepends on the model/dataset combination. We find that using training data to\ngenerate label definitions outperforms using the same data as demonstrations\nfor in-context learning for two out of three datasets using OpenAI models. The\nexperiments further show that using the LLMs to refine label definitions brings\nan average increase of 3.9% F1 in 10 out of 12 setups compared to the\nperformance of the non-refined definitions. Combining fine-tuned models with\nself-refined term definitions results in the overall highest performance,\noutperforming zero-shot prompting fine-tuned models by at least 3% in F1 score.\nThe costs analysis shows that while reaching similar F1 score, self-refinement\nvia prompting is more cost efficient for use cases requiring smaller amounts of\ntables to be annotated while fine-tuning is more efficient for large amounts of\ntables.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have found that summaries generated by large language models\n(LLMs) are favored by human annotators over the original reference summaries in\ncommonly used summarization datasets. Therefore, we study an LLM-as-reference\nlearning setting for smaller text summarization models to investigate whether\ntheir performance can be substantially improved. To this end, we use LLMs as\nboth oracle summary generators for standard supervised fine-tuning and oracle\nsummary evaluators for efficient contrastive learning that leverages the LLMs'\nsupervision signals. We conduct comprehensive experiments with source news\narticles and find that (1) summarization models trained under the\nLLM-as-reference setting achieve significant performance improvement in both\nLLM and human evaluations; (2) contrastive learning outperforms standard\nsupervised fine-tuning under both low and high resource settings. Our\nexperimental results also enable a meta-analysis of LLMs' summary evaluation\ncapacities under a challenging setting, showing that LLMs are not well-aligned\nwith human evaluators. Particularly, our expert human evaluation reveals\nremaining nuanced performance gaps between LLMs and our fine-tuned models,\nwhich LLMs fail to capture. Thus, we call for further studies into both the\npotential and challenges of using LLMs in summarization model development.",

This paper explores the zero-shot abilities\nof recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of\nliterature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two\ncomponents: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing\na literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective\nLLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step\nsearch strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the\nabstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying\nan external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking\nmechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized\nrecall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the\nLLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step\napproach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in\nthe plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based\nliterature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a\nprotocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set\ncontamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to\npromote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical\nresults suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature\nreviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and\nplanning.

It is a\ntedious task which makes an automatic literature review generator appealing.\nUnfortunately, many existing works that generate such reviews using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have significant limitations. They tend to\nhallucinate-generate non-factual information-and ignore the latest research\nthey have not been trained on. To address these limitations, we propose a\ntoolkit that operates on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) principles,\nspecialized prompting and instructing techniques with the help of LLMs. Our\nsystem first initiates a web search to retrieve relevant papers by summarizing\nuser-provided abstracts into keywords using an off-the-shelf LLM. Authors can\nenhance the search by supplementing it with relevant papers or keywords,\ncontributing to a tailored retrieval process. Second, the system re-ranks the\nretrieved papers based on the user-provided abstract. Finally, the related work\nsection is generated based on the re-ranked results and the abstract. There is\na substantial reduction in time and effort for literature review compared to\ntraditional methods, establishing our toolkit as an efficient alternative.

The\nprevious LLM-based studies on literature review mainly focused on the complete\nprocess, including literature retrieval, screening, and summarization. However,\nfor the summarization step, simple CoT method often lacks the ability to\nprovide extensive comparative summary. In this work, we firstly focus on the\nindependent literature summarization step and introduce ChatCite, an LLM agent\nwith human workflow guidance for comparative literature summary. This agent, by\nmimicking the human workflow, first extracts key elements from relevant\nliterature and then generates summaries using a Reflective Incremental\nMechanism. In order to better evaluate the quality of the generated summaries,\nwe devised a LLM-based automatic evaluation metric, G-Score, in refer to the\nhuman evaluation criteria. The ChatCite agent outperformed other models in\nvarious dimensions in the experiments. The literature summaries generated by\nChatCite can also be directly used for drafting literature reviews.",

As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase\nof ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold\ntransformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they\nalso pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey\npaper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin\nwith a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review\nwhat ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the\nincorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods,\nnew datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for\nASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and\ninvestigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR.\nLastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for\nASPR.

Among them, academia is not simply a domain\naffected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs.\nIn academic publications, this phenomenon is represented during the\nincorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts.\nWe proposed the concept of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) in our\nprevious paper. As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase\nof ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold\ntransformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they\nalso pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey\npaper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin\nwith a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review\nwhat ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the\nincorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods,\nnew datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for\nASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and\ninvestigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR.\nLastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for\nASPR. We hope this survey can serve as an inspirational reference for the\nresearchers and promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.",

This paper explores the zero-shot abilities\nof recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of\nliterature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two\ncomponents: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing\na literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective\nLLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step\nsearch strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the\nabstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying\nan external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking\nmechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized\nrecall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the\nLLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step\napproach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in\nthe plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based\nliterature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a\nprotocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set\ncontamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to\npromote additional research and development in this regard.

With the\nadvancement of general-purpose large language models (LLMs), the ability to\ncode stands out as one important measure to the model's reasoning performance.\nUsually, a two-stage training paradigm is implemented to obtain a Code LLM,\nnamely the pretraining and the fine-tuning. Within the fine-tuning, supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL) are often used to improve\nthe model's zero-shot ability. A large number of work has been conducted to\nimprove the model's performance on code-related benchmarks with either\nmodifications to the algorithm or refinement of the dataset. However, we still\nlack a deep insight into the correlation between SFT and RL. For instance, what\nkind of dataset should be used to ensure generalization, or what if we abandon\nthe SFT phase in fine-tuning. In this work, we make an attempt to understand\nthe correlation between SFT and RL. To facilitate our research, we manually\ncraft 100 basis python functions, called atomic functions, and then a\nsynthesizing pipeline is deployed to create a large number of synthetic\nfunctions on top of the atomic ones. In this manner, we ensure that the train\nand test sets remain distinct, preventing data contamination. Through\ncomprehensive ablation study, we find: (1) Both atomic and synthetic functions\nare indispensable for SFT's generalization, and only a handful of synthetic\nfunctions are adequate; (2) Through RL, the SFT's generalization to target\ndomain can be greatly enhanced, even with the same training prompts; (3)\nTraining RL from scratch can alleviate the over-fitting issue introduced in the\nSFT phase.",

It is widely believed that\nRLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning\nabilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study,\nhowever, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the\npass@\\textit{k} metric with large values of \\textit{k} to explore the reasoning\ncapability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and\nbenchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \\emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally\nnew reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at\nsmaller values of $k$ (\\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or\neven higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$\nvalues. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included\nin the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning\nabilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models.\nFurther analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the\nmodel's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards,\ntherefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in\na narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar\nresults are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we\nfind that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model,\ndifferent from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in\nadvancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink\nthe impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.\nProject Page: https://limit-of-RLVR.github.io",

(3)\nFull-parameter fine-tuning increases hallucination by inaccurately borrowing\ntokens from conceptually similar instances in the IT dataset for generating\nresponses. (4) Popular methods to improve IT do not lead to performance\nimprovements over a simple LoRA fine-tuned model. Our findings reveal that\nresponses generated solely from pre-trained knowledge consistently outperform\nresponses by models that learn any form of new knowledge from IT on open-source\ndatasets. We hope the insights and challenges revealed in this paper inspire\nfuture work in related directions.",

However,\nLLMs can also answer questions that are unethical or harmful, raising concerns\nabout their applications. To regulate LLMs' responses to such questions, a\ntraining strategy called \\textit{alignment} can help. Yet, alignment can be\nunexpectedly compromised when fine-tuning an LLM for downstream tasks. This\npaper focuses on recovering the alignment lost during fine-tuning.\n  We observe that there are two distinct directions inherent in an aligned LLM:\nthe \\textit{aligned direction} and the \\textit{harmful direction}. An LLM is\ninclined to answer questions in the aligned direction while refusing queries in\nthe harmful direction. Therefore, we propose to recover the harmful direction\nof the fine-tuned model that has been compromised. Specifically, we restore a\nsmall subset of the fine-tuned model's weight parameters from the original\naligned model using gradient descent. We also introduce a rollback mechanism to\navoid aggressive recovery and maintain downstream task performance. Our\nevaluation on 125 fine-tuned LLMs demonstrates that our method can reduce their\nharmful rate (percentage of answering harmful questions) from 33.25\\% to\n1.74\\%, without sacrificing task performance much. In contrast, the existing\nmethods either only reduce the harmful rate to a limited extent or\nsignificantly impact the normal functionality.

However, the potential of reward models during RL training time still\nremains largely under-explored. It is currently unclear whether these reward\nmodels can provide additional training signals to enhance the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs in RL training that uses sparse success rewards, which\nverify the correctness of solutions. In this work, we evaluate popular reward\nmodels for RL training, including the Outcome-supervised Reward Model (ORM) and\nthe Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM), and train a collection of LLMs for\nmath problems using RL by combining these learned rewards with success rewards.\nSurprisingly, even though these learned reward models have strong\ninference-time performances, they may NOT help or even hurt RL training,\nproducing worse performances than LLMs trained with the success reward only.\nOur analysis reveals that an LLM can receive high rewards from some of these\nreward models by repeating correct but unnecessary reasoning steps, leading to\na severe reward hacking issue. Therefore, we introduce two novel reward\nrefinement techniques, including Clipping and Delta. The key idea is to ensure\nthe accumulative reward of any reasoning trajectory is upper-bounded to keep a\nlearned reward model effective without being exploited. We evaluate our\ntechniques with multiple reward models over a set of 1.5B and 7B LLMs on MATH\nand GSM8K benchmarks and demonstrate that with a carefully designed reward\nfunction, RL training without any additional supervised tuning can improve all\nthe evaluated LLMs, including the state-of-the-art 7B LLM\nQwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.",

            "abstract": "In-context learning enables large language models (LLMs) to perform a variety\nof tasks, including learning to make reward-maximizing choices in simple bandit\ntasks. Given their potential use as (autonomous) decision-making agents, it is\nimportant to understand how these models perform such reinforcement learning\n(RL) tasks and the extent to which they are susceptible to biases. Motivated by\nthe fact that, in humans, it has been widely documented that the value of an\noutcome depends on how it compares to other local outcomes, the present study\nfocuses on whether similar value encoding biases apply to how LLMs encode\nrewarding outcomes. Results from experiments with multiple bandit tasks and\nmodels show that LLMs exhibit behavioral signatures of a relative value bias.\nAdding explicit outcome comparisons to the prompt produces opposing effects on\nperformance, enhancing maximization in trained choice sets but impairing\ngeneralization to new choice sets. Computational cognitive modeling reveals\nthat LLM behavior is well-described by a simple RL algorithm that incorporates\nrelative values at the outcome encoding stage. Lastly, we present preliminary\nevidence that the observed biases are not limited to fine-tuned LLMs, and that\nrelative value processing is detectable in the final hidden layer activations\nof a raw, pretrained model. These findings have important implications for the\nuse of LLMs in decision-making applications.",

However, current\nbias mitigation methods often require intensive human feedback, lack\ntransferability to other topics or yield overconfident and random outputs. We\nfind that involving LLMs in role-playing scenario boosts their ability to\nrecognize and mitigate biases.

We utilize LLMs in\nmulti-role debates to create a dataset that includes both high-bias and\nlow-bias instances for training the reward model in reinforcement learning. Our\napproach comprises two modes: (1) self-reflection, where the same LLM\nparticipates in multi-role debates, and (2) teacher-student, where a more\nadvanced LLM like GPT-3.5-turbo guides the LLM to perform this task.\nExperimental results across different LLMs on BBQ and our datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach in bias mitigation.

In this work, we systematically study\nwhy LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we\nclosely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and\nthe knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by\nfine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales.\nOur experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and\nTic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making\nabilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing\ngap.

This paper introduces a novel task, episode detection, aimed\nat identifying episodes from a news corpus containing key event articles.

Furthermore, an\nepisode is a significant part of a larger group of episodes under a particular\nkey event. Automatically detecting episodes is challenging because, unlike key\nevents and atomic actions, we cannot rely on explicit mentions of times and\nlocations to distinguish between episodes or use semantic similarity to merge\ninconsistent episode co-references. To address these challenges, we introduce\nEpiMine, an unsupervised episode detection framework that (1) automatically\nidentifies the most salient, key-event-relevant terms and segments, (2)\ndetermines candidate episodes in an article based on natural episodic\npartitions estimated through shifts in discriminative term combinations, and\n(3) refines and forms final episode clusters using large language model-based\nreasoning on the candidate episodes.

As real-world events have different\ngranularities, from the top-level themes to key events and then to event\nmentions corresponding to concrete actions, there are generally two lines of\nresearch: (1) theme detection identifies from a news corpus major themes (e.g.,\n\"2019 Hong Kong Protests\" vs. \"2020 U.S. Presidential Election\") that have very\ndistinct semantics; and (2) action extraction extracts from one document\nmention-level actions (e.g., \"the police hit the left arm of the protester\")\nthat are too fine-grained for comprehending the event. In this paper, we\npropose a new task, key event detection at the intermediate level, aiming to\ndetect from a news corpus key events (e.g., \"HK Airport Protest on Aug.\n12-14\"), each happening at a particular time/location and focusing on the same\ntopic. This task can bridge event understanding and structuring and is\ninherently challenging because of the thematic and temporal closeness of key\nevents and the scarcity of labeled data due to the fast-evolving nature of news\narticles. To address these challenges, we develop an unsupervised key event\ndetection framework, EvMine, that (1) extracts temporally frequent peak phrases\nusing a novel ttf-itf score, (2) merges peak phrases into event-indicative\nfeature sets by detecting communities from our designed peak phrase graph that\ncaptures document co-occurrences, semantic similarities, and temporal closeness\nsignals, and (3) iteratively retrieves documents related to each key event by\ntraining a classifier with automatically generated pseudo labels from the\nevent-indicative feature sets and refining the detected key events using the\nretrieved documents. Extensive experiments and case studies show EvMine\noutperforms all the baseline methods and its ablations on two real-world news\ncorpora.",

To address this\nissue, we propose an optimization strategy called \"Definition-driven\nDocument-level Event Extraction (DDEE).\" By adjusting the length of the prompt\nand enhancing the clarity of heuristics, we have significantly improved the\nevent extraction performance of LLMs. We used data balancing techniques to\nsolve the long-tail effect problem, enhancing the model's generalization\nability for event types. At the same time, we refined the prompt to ensure it\nis both concise and comprehensive, adapting to the sensitivity of LLMs to the\nstyle of prompts. In addition, the introduction of structured heuristic methods\nand strict limiting conditions has improved the precision of event and argument\nrole extraction. These strategies not only solve the prompt engineering\nproblems of LLMs in document-level event extraction but also promote the\ndevelopment of event extraction technology, providing new research perspectives\nfor other tasks in the NLP field.",

In this work, we introduce two\nnovel LLM-powered data augmentation frameworks for synthesizing extractive\ndocument-level EAE samples using zero in-domain training data. Our highest\nperforming methods provide a 16-pt increase in F1 score on extraction of zero\nshot role types.\n  To better facilitate analysis of cross-domain EAE, we additionally introduce\na new metric, Role-Depth F1 (RDF1), which uses statistical depth to identify\nroles in the target domain which are semantic outliers with respect to roles\nobserved in the source domain. Our experiments show that LLM-based augmentation\ncan boost RDF1 performance by up to 11 F1 points compared to baseline methods.",

Next, a voting phase\nconsolidates the annotation preferences across different LLMs. Finally, we\ncreate the EEMT dataset, the largest EE dataset to date, featuring over 200,000\nsamples, 3,465 event types, and 6,297 role types. For the second challenge, we\npropose an LLM-based Partitioning EE method called LLM-PEE. To overcome the\nlimited context length of LLMs, LLM-PEE first recalls candidate event types and\nthen splits them into multiple partitions for LLMs to extract events. The\nresults in the supervised setting show that LLM-PEE outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by 5.4 in event detection and 6.1 in argument\nextraction. In the zero-shot setting, LLM-PEE achieves up to 12.9 improvement\ncompared to mainstream LLMs, demonstrating its strong generalization\ncapabilities.",

Exploring\nthis field could result in the creation of techniques and resources that\nsupport literary scholars in improving their effectiveness. This could\nsimultaneously influence the field of Natural Language Processing. Our\nobjective is to clarify the intricate idea of events in the context of short\nstories. Towards the objective, we collected 1,000 short stories written mostly\nfor children in the Indian context. Further, we present fresh guidelines for\nannotating event mentions and their categories, organized into \\textit{seven\ndistinct classes}. The classes are {\\tt{COGNITIVE-MENTAL-STATE(CMS),\nCOMMUNICATION(COM), CONFLICT(CON), GENERAL-ACTIVITY(GA), LIFE-EVENT(LE),\nMOVEMENT(MOV), and OTHERS(OTH)}}. Subsequently, we apply these guidelines to\nannotate the short story dataset. Later, we apply the baseline methods for\nautomatically detecting and categorizing events.

CsEAE includes a co-occurrences-aware module, which integrates\ninformation about all events present in the current input through context\nlabeling and co-occurrences event prompts extraction.

First, implicit arguments are\nevent arguments which are not explicitly mentioned in the text, but can be\ninferred through context. Second, scattered arguments are event arguments that\nare composed of information scattered throughout the text. These two argument\ntypes are crucial to elicit the full breadth of information required for proper\nevent modeling.\n  To support the extraction of explicit, implicit, and scattered arguments, we\ndevelop a novel dataset, DiscourseEE, which includes 7,464 argument annotations\nfrom online health discourse. Notably, 51.2% of the arguments are implicit, and\n17.4% are scattered, making DiscourseEE a unique corpus for complex event\nextraction. Additionally, we formulate argument extraction as a text generation\nproblem to facilitate the extraction of complex argument types.

To address this\ndegradation, we employed model merging techniques, integrating single-task\ndomain-specific fine-tuned models with the base model. Using this merging\nmethod resulted in significant enhancements in zero-shot performance, even\nexceeding the original model's accuracy on certain datasets.

In\nthis paper, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting a comprehensive study on\nsupervised fine-tuning of LLMs using instruction-tuning datasets spanning\ndiverse knowledge domains and skills. We focus on small-sized LLMs (3B to 7B\nparameters) for their cost-efficiency and accessibility. We explore various\ntraining configurations and strategies across four open-source pre-trained\nmodels. We provide detailed documentation of these configurations, revealing\nfindings that challenge several common training practices, including\nhyperparameter recommendations from TULU and phased training recommended by\nOrca. Key insights from our work include: (i) larger batch sizes paired with\nlower learning rates lead to improved model performance on benchmarks such as\nMMLU, MTBench, and Open LLM Leaderboard; (ii) early-stage training dynamics,\nsuch as lower gradient norms and higher loss values, are strong indicators of\nbetter final model performance, enabling early termination of sub-optimal runs\nand significant computational savings; (iii) through a thorough exploration of\nhyperparameters like warmup steps and learning rate schedules, we provide\nguidance for practitioners and find that certain simplifications do not\ncompromise performance; and (iv) we observed no significant difference in\nperformance between phased and stacked training strategies, but stacked\ntraining is simpler and more sample efficient.

In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs\nand want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content\nwithin the institution. We answer the following question: Given a piece of\ntext, can we identify whether it was produced by LLM $A$ or $B$ (where $B$ can\nbe a human)? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process\nwith complete dependence on history and design zero-shot statistical tests to\ndistinguish between (i) the text generated by two different sets of LLMs $A$\n(in-house) and $B$ (non-sanctioned) and also (ii) LLM-generated and\nhuman-generated texts. We prove that our tests' type I and type II errors\ndecrease exponentially as text length increases. For designing our tests for a\ngiven string, we demonstrate that if the string is generated by the evaluator\nmodel $A$, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$ converges to the average\nentropy of the string under $A$, except with an exponentially small probability\nin the string length. We also show that if $B$ generates the text, except with\nan exponentially small probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the\nstring under $A$ converges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. For our\nexperiments: First, we present experiments using open-source LLMs to support\nour theoretical results, and then we provide experiments in a black-box setting\nwith adversarial attacks. Practically, our work enables guaranteed finding of\nthe origin of harmful or false LLM-generated text, which can be useful for\ncombating misinformation and compliance with emerging AI regulations.",

In this paper, we identify a new\nfeature, token cohesiveness, that is useful for zero-shot detection, and we\ndemonstrate that LLM-generated text tends to exhibit higher token cohesiveness\nthan human-written text. Based on this observation, we devise TOCSIN, a generic\ndual-channel detection paradigm that uses token cohesiveness as a plug-and-play\nmodule to improve existing zero-shot detectors.

In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of watermarking\nLLMs as a deterrent against the generation of copyrighted texts. Through\ntheoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that\nincorporating watermarks into LLMs significantly reduces the likelihood of\ngenerating copyrighted content, thereby addressing a critical concern in the\ndeployment of LLMs. However, we also find that watermarking can have unintended\nconsequences on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to discern\nwhether a sample was part of the pretraining dataset and may be used to detect\ncopyright violations. Surprisingly, we find that watermarking adversely affects\nthe success rate of MIAs, complicating the task of detecting copyrighted text\nin the pretraining dataset. These results reveal the complex interplay between\ndifferent regulatory measures, which may impact each other in unforeseen ways.\nFinally, we propose an adaptive technique to improve the success rate of a\nrecent MIA under watermarking.

As LLMs increasingly contribute to software development, watermarking\nhas emerged as a potential solution for detecting AI generated code and\nmitigating misuse, such as plagiarism or the automated generation of malicious\nprograms. While previous research has demonstrated the resilience of\nwatermarking in the text setting, our work reveals that watermarking techniques\nare significantly more fragile in code-based contexts. Specifically, we show\nthat simple semantic-preserving transformations, such as variable renaming and\ndead code insertion, can effectively erase watermarks without altering the\nprogram's functionality. To systematically evaluate watermark robustness, we\ndevelop an algorithm that traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a\nwatermarked program and applies a sequence of randomized, semantics-preserving\ntransformations. Our experimental results, conducted on Python code generated\nby different LLMs, indicate that even minor modifications can drastically\nreduce watermark detectability, with true positive rates (TPR) dropping below\n50% in many cases.

However, the security against spoofing\nattacks remains relatively understudied. For example, a piggyback attack can\nmaliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate\nspeech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation\nof the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending\nagainst spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to\nsemantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and\n(2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the\nlocal, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes.

For example, a piggyback attack can\nmaliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate\nspeech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation\nof the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending\nagainst spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to\nsemantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and\n(2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the\nlocal, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes.

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the\ninductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through iterative hypothesis\nrefinement, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process\nthan standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a\nthree-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form\nof textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs are\nphenomenal hypothesis proposers (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when\ncoupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to\nsystematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves\nstrong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing\ncausal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However,\nthey also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance\ngaps between rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule\napplication (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs\nare proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules.\nThrough empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies\nbetween the inductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on\nboth the potentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks.",

However, current LLMs that learn from human\nor external model supervision are costly and may face performance ceilings as\ntask complexity and diversity increase. To address this issue, self-evolution\napproaches that enable LLM to autonomously acquire, refine, and learn from\nexperiences generated by the model itself are rapidly growing. This new\ntraining paradigm inspired by the human experiential learning process offers\nthe potential to scale LLMs towards superintelligence. In this work, we present\na comprehensive survey of self-evolution approaches in LLMs. We first propose a\nconceptual framework for self-evolution and outline the evolving process as\niterative cycles composed of four phases: experience acquisition, experience\nrefinement, updating, and evaluation. Second, we categorize the evolution\nobjectives of LLMs and LLM-based agents; then, we summarize the literature and\nprovide taxonomy and insights for each module. Lastly, we pinpoint existing\nchallenges and propose future directions to improve self-evolution frameworks,\nequipping researchers with critical insights to fast-track the development of\nself-evolving LLMs. Our corresponding GitHub repository is available at\nhttps://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/Awesome-Self-Evolution-of-LLM",

In RQ2, we\nanalyze the methods used in data collection, preprocessing, and application,\nhighlighting the role of well-curated datasets for successful LLM for SE\nimplementation. RQ3 investigates the strategies employed to optimize and\nevaluate the performance of LLMs in SE. Finally, RQ4 examines the specific SE\ntasks where LLMs have shown success to date, illustrating their practical\ncontributions to the field. From the answers to these RQs, we discuss the\ncurrent state-of-the-art and trends, identifying gaps in existing research, and\nflagging promising areas for future study.

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language\nModels (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed,\nfacilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable\nperformance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field,\nit is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements,\nchallenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first\nsystematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR\nbetween 2020 and 2024. We analyze 127 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their\nintegration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are\napplied to support APR and outline three types of utilization strategies for\ntheir deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that\nbenefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities.\nFurthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR\nresearch, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of\nchallenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future\nresearch. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research\nlandscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive\nunderstanding of achievements and promote future research.",

In this paper, we\nfirst define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive\nreview of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and\ncognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that\nclassifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external\nknowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive\nempirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches.\nAdditionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can\ngive a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs.\nFinally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing,\noutlining its broad and impactful implications.",

The\ndisadvantage is exacerbated when new knowledge frequently needs to be\nintroduced into the pre-trained model. Therefore, it is imperative to develop\neffective and efficient techniques to update pre-trained LLMs. Traditional\nmethods encode new knowledge in pre-trained LLMs through direct fine-tuning.\nHowever, naively re-training LLMs can be computationally intensive and risks\ndegenerating valuable pre-trained knowledge irrelevant to the update in the\nmodel.

In this\nsurvey, we aim to provide a comprehensive and in-depth overview of recent\nadvances in the field of KME.

One\nrecent strategy to fix these issues is to refine the code generated from LLMs\nusing the input from the model itself (self-augmented). In this work, we\nproposed a novel method, namely CoT-SelfEvolve.

Focusing\non data science code, including Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, our\nevaluations on the DS-1000 dataset demonstrate that CoT-SelfEvolve\nsignificantly outperforms existing models in solving complex problems. The\nframework shows substantial improvements in both initial code generation and\nsubsequent iterations, with the model's accuracy increasing significantly with\neach additional iteration. This highlights the effectiveness of using\nchain-of-thought prompting to address complexities revealed by program executor\ntraceback error messages.

Our findings reveal that LLMs can be customized for\nspecific educational tasks through tailor-making techniques such as in-context\nlearning and agent-based approaches, effectively managing complex and\nunbalanced educational data.

We also propose a theoretical framework for how\n(i) purpose of the interaction, (ii) internal factors (e.g., the user's\npersonality), and (iii) external factors (e.g., company policy) together shape\nthe experience (in terms of perceived usefulness and trust). We envision that\nour framework can be used by future research to further the academic discussion\non LLM usage by software engineering practitioners, and to serve as a reference\npoint for the design of future empirical LLM research in this domain.",

This pre-registered study\nevaluates GPT-4's capability in title/abstract screening, full-text review, and\ndata extraction across various literature types and languages using a\n'human-out-of-the-loop' approach. Although GPT-4 had accuracy on par with human\nperformance in most tasks, results were skewed by chance agreement and dataset\nimbalance. After adjusting for these, there was a moderate level of performance\nfor data extraction, and - barring studies that used highly reliable prompts -\nscreening performance levelled at none to moderate for different stages and\nlanguages. When screening full-text literature using highly reliable prompts,\nGPT-4's performance was 'almost perfect.' Penalising GPT-4 for missing key\nstudies using highly reliable prompts improved its performance even more.

We introduce GeneralPoints, an\narithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation\nenvironment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen\nvariants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when\ntrained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based\ntextual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data\nand struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis\nreveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition\ncapabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain.\nDespite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for\neffective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling\nsubsequent RL to achieve its performance gains.

To address this,\nwe propose Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning(PAFT), a simple yet effective approach\nthat dynamically adjusts prompts during fine-tuning. This encourages the model\nto learn underlying task principles rather than overfitting to specific prompt\nformulations.

While\nthese paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often\ninvolve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning.\nTo systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new\nmultimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a\nsix-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite\nand verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual\nreasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same\ndata source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing\nSFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn\nreasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid\nreasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module\nintegrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more\ngenuine, adaptive reasoning behavior.

Extensive\nexperiments on RobustAlpacaEval with ChatGPT and six open-source LLMs from the\nLlama, Mistral, and Gemma families uncover substantial variability in model\nperformance; for instance, a difference of 45.48% between the worst and best\nperformance for the Llama-2-70B-chat model, with its worst performance dipping\nas low as 9.38%. We further illustrate the difficulty in identifying the worst\nprompt from both model-agnostic and model-dependent perspectives, emphasizing\nthe absence of a shortcut to characterize the worst prompt. We also attempt to\nenhance the worst prompt performance using existing prompt engineering and\nprompt consistency methods, but find that their impact is limited. These\nfindings underscore the need to create more resilient LLMs that can maintain\nhigh performance across diverse prompts.

Under this mental model, LLMs should be\nthought of as actors; prompts as scripts and cues; and LLM responses as\nperformances. We apply this mental model to the task of improving LLM\nperformance at playing Connections, a New York Times word puzzle game that\nprior research identified as a challenging benchmark for evaluating LLM\nreasoning. Our experiments with GPT-4o show that a \"Method Actors\" approach can\nsignificantly improve LLM performance over both a vanilla and \"Chain of\nThoughts\" approach. A vanilla approach solves 27% of Connections puzzles in our\ndataset and a \"Chain of Thoughts\" approach solves 41% of puzzles, whereas our\nstrongest \"Method Actor\" approach solves 86% of puzzles. We also test OpenAI's\nnewest model designed specifically for complex reasoning tasks, o1-preview.\nWhen asked to solve a puzzle all at once, o1-preview solves 79% of Connections\npuzzles in our dataset, and when allowed to build puzzle solutions one guess at\na time over multiple API calls, o1-preview solves 100% of the puzzles.\nIncorporating a \"Method Actor\" prompt architecture increases the percentage of\npuzzles that o1-preview solves perfectly from 76% to 87%.",

While manual prompt\nengineering faces limitations in scalability, adaptability, and cross-modal\nalignment, automated methods, spanning foundation model (FM) based\noptimization, evolutionary methods, gradient-based optimization, and\nreinforcement learning, offer promising solutions. Existing surveys, however,\nremain fragmented across modalities and methodologies. This paper presents the\nfirst comprehensive survey on automated prompt engineering through a unified\noptimization-theoretic lens. We formalize prompt optimization as a maximization\nproblem over discrete, continuous, and hybrid prompt spaces, systematically\norganizing methods by their optimization variables (instructions, soft prompts,\nexemplars), task-specific objectives, and computational frameworks. By bridging\ntheoretical formulation with practical implementations across text, vision, and\nmultimodal domains, this survey establishes a foundational framework for both\nresearchers and practitioners, while highlighting underexplored frontiers in\nconstrained optimization and agent-oriented prompt design.",

LLMs, due to their training, are sensitive to how exactly a question is\npresented, also known as prompting. However, prompting well is challenging, as\nit has been difficult to uncover principles behind prompting -- generally,\ntrial-and-error is the most common way of improving prompts, despite its\nsignificant computational cost. In this context, we argue it would be useful to\nperform `predictive prompt analysis', in which an automated technique would\nperform a quick analysis of a prompt and predict how the LLM would react to it,\nrelative to a goal provided by the user. As a demonstration of the concept, we\npresent Syntactic Prevalence Analyzer (SPA), a predictive prompt analysis\napproach based on sparse autoencoders (SAEs). SPA accurately predicted how\noften an LLM would generate target syntactic structures during code synthesis,\nwith up to 0.994 Pearson correlation between the predicted and actual\nprevalence of the target structure. At the same time, SPA requires only 0.4\\%\nof the time it takes to run the LLM on a benchmark. As LLMs are increasingly\nused during and integrated into modern software development, our proposed\npredictive prompt analysis concept has the potential to significantly ease the\nuse of LLMs for both practitioners and researchers.",

Existing alignment methodologies primarily address single task,\nsuch as multi-turn dialogue, coding, mathematical problem-solving, and tool\nusage. Although there is a large amount of high-quality data available for\nthose tasks, most of them provide only questions and answers without including\nthe system prompt. Though a detailed analysis of the Qwen language model, we\nfound that the system prompt has a significant impact on both training and\ninference processes of LLM. We attributes this phenomenon to overfitting to the\nsystem prompt. In address this issue, we introduce a novel technique termed\nMixture-of-Instructions (MoI), which employs a strategy of instruction packing\ncombined with diverse system prompts to boost the alignment efficiency of\nlanguage models. We have also compiled a diverse set of seven benchmark\ndatasets to rigorously evaluate the alignment efficacy of the MoI-enhanced\nlanguage model. Our methodology was applied to the open-source Qwen-7B-chat\nmodel, culminating in the development of Qwen-SFT-MoI. This enhanced model\ndemonstrates significant advancements in generative capabilities across coding,\nmathematics, and tool use tasks.",

This position paper argues that LRMs\nsubstantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT\nparadigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires\ncontextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify\nthree foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve\nambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over\ncross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural\nintentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent,\naudience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can\nperform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential\nerrors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better\nrobustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various\nscenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level\ntranslation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that\ndemonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several\ninteresting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as\nwell as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and\ninference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation\nsystems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents\ncapable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds\nus to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios\nin a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.",

Machine\ncommon sense has long been a critical-but-missing component of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI). Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in new AI\ncapabilities, but in all of these applications, machine reasoning is narrow and\nhighly specialized. Developers must carefully train or program systems for\nevery situation. General commonsense reasoning remains elusive. The absence of\ncommon sense prevents intelligent systems from understanding their world,\nbehaving reasonably in unforeseen situations, communicating naturally with\npeople, and learning from new experiences. Its absence is perhaps the most\nsignificant barrier between the narrowly focused AI applications we have today\nand the more general, human-like AI systems we would like to build in the\nfuture. Machine common sense remains a broad, potentially unbounded problem in\nAI. There are a wide range of strategies that could be employed to make\nprogress on this difficult challenge. This paper discusses two diverse\nstrategies for focusing development on two different machine commonsense\nservices: (1) a service that learns from experience, like a child, to construct\ncomputational models that mimic the core domains of child cognition for objects\n(intuitive physics), agents (intentional actors), and places (spatial\nnavigation); and (2) service that learns from reading the Web, like a research\nlibrarian, to construct a commonsense knowledge repository capable of answering\nnatural language and image-based questions about commonsense phenomena.",

To assess the utility of\nsynthetic data, we fine-tune language models on classification and generation\ntasks using this data and evaluate performance on a human-written test set.

However, most use cases of\ndiffusion models are not concerned with likelihoods, but instead with\ndownstream objectives such as human-perceived image quality or drug\neffectiveness. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning methods for\ndirectly optimizing diffusion models for such objectives. We describe how\nposing denoising as a multi-step decision-making problem enables a class of\npolicy gradient algorithms, which we refer to as denoising diffusion policy\noptimization (DDPO), that are more effective than alternative reward-weighted\nlikelihood approaches. Empirically, DDPO is able to adapt text-to-image\ndiffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting,\nsuch as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as\naesthetic quality. Finally, we show that DDPO can improve prompt-image\nalignment using feedback from a vision-language model without the need for\nadditional data collection or human annotation.

These include two training-time strategies: direct\npreference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for\nflow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies\nreward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that\nVideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO\ndemonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard\nsupervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom\nweights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video\nquality needs. Project page: https://gongyeliu.github.io/videoalign.",

Proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy\noptimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive\nto hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE,\non the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high\nmemory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal\nperformance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of\nthe REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and\nusing a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To\naddress these challenges, we systematically analyze the\nefficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose\nleave-one-out PPO (LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP\ncombines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling\nmultiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the\nrobustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling.\nOur results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on\nvarious black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between\ncomputational efficiency and performance.",

Recent diffusion models for video generation have\npredominantly utilized attention layers to extract temporal features. However,\nattention layers are limited by their computational costs, which increase\nquadratically with the sequence length. This limitation presents significant\nchallenges when generating longer video sequences using diffusion models. To\novercome this challenge, we propose leveraging state-space models (SSMs) as\ntemporal feature extractors. SSMs (e.g., Mamba) have recently gained attention\nas promising alternatives due to their linear-time memory consumption relative\nto sequence length. In line with previous research suggesting that using\nbidirectional SSMs is effective for understanding spatial features in image\ngeneration, we found that bidirectionality is also beneficial for capturing\ntemporal features in video data, rather than relying on traditional\nunidirectional SSMs. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on multiple\nlong-term video datasets, such as MineRL Navigate, across various model sizes.\nFor sequences up to 256 frames, SSM-based models require less memory to achieve\nthe same FVD as attention-based models. Moreover, SSM-based models often\ndeliver better performance with comparable GPU memory usage. Our codes are\navailable at https://github.com/shim0114/SSM-Meets-Video-Diffusion-Models.",

In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning methods for\ndirectly optimizing diffusion models for such objectives. We describe how\nposing denoising as a multi-step decision-making problem enables a class of\npolicy gradient algorithms, which we refer to as denoising diffusion policy\noptimization (DDPO), that are more effective than alternative reward-weighted\nlikelihood approaches. Empirically, DDPO is able to adapt text-to-image\ndiffusion models to objectives that are difficult to express via prompting,\nsuch as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as\naesthetic quality.

Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of\nextending existing methods for broader real-world applications lies in the\ncomputational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is\nconsiderably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to\ngenerate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the\nflexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning\nperspective. In particular, by exploiting the connection between diffusion\nmodels and energy-based models, we develop Diffusion Spectral Representation\n(Diff-SR), a coherent algorithm framework that enables extracting sufficient\nrepresentations for value functions in Markov decision processes (MDP) and\npartially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We further demonstrate\nhow Diff-SR facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms\nwhile explicitly bypassing the difficulty and inference cost of sampling from\nthe diffusion model. Finally, we provide comprehensive empirical studies to\nverify the benefits of Diff-SR in delivering robust and advantageous\nperformance across various benchmarks with both fully and partially observable\nsettings.",

However, careful evaluations by human reveal that the\ntranslations produced by LLMs still contain multiple errors. Importantly,\nfeeding back such error information into the LLMs can lead to self-refinement\nand result in improved translation performance. Motivated by these insights, we\nintroduce a systematic LLM-based self-refinement translation framework, named\n\\textbf{TEaR}, which stands for \\textbf{T}ranslate, \\textbf{E}stimate,\n\\textbf{a}nd \\textbf{R}efine, marking a significant step forward in this\ndirection. Our findings demonstrate that 1) our self-refinement framework\nsuccessfully assists LLMs in improving their translation quality across a wide\nrange of languages, whether it's from high-resource languages to low-resource\nones or whether it's English-centric or centered around other languages; 2)\nTEaR exhibits superior systematicity and interpretability; 3) different\nestimation strategies yield varied impacts, directly affecting the\neffectiveness of the final corrections. Additionally, traditional neural\ntranslation models and evaluation models operate separately, often focusing on\nsingular tasks due to their limited capabilities, while general-purpose LLMs\npossess the capability to undertake both tasks simultaneously. We further\nconduct cross-model correction experiments to investigate the potential\nrelationship between the translation and evaluation capabilities of\ngeneral-purpose LLMs. Our code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/fzp0424/self_correct_mt",

To\naddress this, we propose a novel approach that leverages fine-grained,\ntoken-level quality assessments along with error severity levels using RL\nmethods. Specifically, we use xCOMET, a state-of-the-art quality estimation\nsystem, as our token-level reward model. We conduct experiments on small and\nlarge translation datasets with standard encoder-decoder and large language\nmodels-based machine translation systems, comparing the impact of\nsentence-level versus fine-grained reward signals on translation quality. Our\nresults show that training with token-level rewards improves translation\nquality across language pairs over baselines according to both automatic and\nhuman evaluation. Furthermore, token-level reward optimization improves\ntraining stability, evidenced by a steady increase in mean rewards over\ntraining epochs.",

This approach relies solely\non the sequence of sentences within the document. However, the complexity of\ndocument-level sequences is greater than that of shorter sentence-level\nsequences, which may limit LLM's ability in DMT when only this single-source\nknowledge is used. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach by\nincorporating multiple sources of knowledge, including both the document\nsummarization and entity translation, to enhance the performance of LLM-based\nDMT. Given a source document, we first obtain its summarization and translation\nof entities via LLM as the additional knowledge. We then utilize LLMs to\ngenerate two translations of the source document by fusing these two single\nknowledge sources, respectively. Finally, recognizing that different sources of\nknowledge may aid or hinder the translation of different sentences, we refine\nand rank the translations by leveraging a multi-knowledge fusion strategy to\nensure the best results. Experimental results in eight document-level\ntranslation tasks show that our approach achieves an average improvement of\n0.8, 0.6, and 0.4 COMET scores over the baseline without extra knowledge for\nLLaMA3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct, and GPT-4o-mini, respectively.",

Hence, domain adaptation (DA) is a crucial issue faced by\ncontemporary NMT and has, so far, been underexplored for low-resource\nlanguages. In this paper, we evaluate a set of methods from both low-resource\nNMT and DA in a realistic setting, in which we aim to translate between a\nhigh-resource and a low-resource language with access to only: a) parallel\nBible data, b) a bilingual dictionary, and c) a monolingual target-domain\ncorpus in the high-resource language. Our results show that the effectiveness\nof the tested methods varies, with the simplest one, DALI, being most\neffective. We follow up with a small human evaluation of DALI, which shows that\nthere is still a need for more careful investigation of how to accomplish DA\nfor low-resource NMT.",

With flexibility, open-source community support, and seamless\nintegration with LLMs, LangGraph empowers agents to deliver high-quality\ntranslations.\n  Together, Agent AI and LangGraph create a cohesive system where LangGraph\norchestrates agent interactions, ensuring that user inputs are analyzed,\nrouted, and processed efficiently.

Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other\ntasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These\napproaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to\nscale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive\nevaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of\nusing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for\nAIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding\ncapabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV\nevaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects\nvideos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human\npreference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we\nextensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while\nadvanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human\nevaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation,\nsignificantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally,\nwe conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the\nperformance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future\nresearch on AIGV evaluation.

The core design philosophy of\nVideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from\nvision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both\nimage and video understanding benchmarks.",

The\nlack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this\ndilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception\ncapabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a\ncomprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT)\ndataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics\nfoundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics\nperception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904\ndiverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are\ncollected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic\ngrades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle\ndiverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and\nassemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT,\nwhich consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic\ncapabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced\ngeneral foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models,\ndubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert\nmodels deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and\nGemini-Pro-Vision.

However, VQA\nremains an extremely challenging task due to the diverse video content and the\ncomplex spatial and temporal distortions, thus necessitating more advanced\nmethods to address these issues. Nowadays, large multimodal models (LMMs), such\nas GPT-4V, have exhibited strong capabilities for various visual understanding\ntasks, motivating us to leverage the powerful multimodal representation ability\nof LMMs to solve the VQA task. Therefore, we propose the first Large\nMulti-Modal Video Quality Assessment (LMM-VQA) model, which introduces a novel\nspatiotemporal visual modeling strategy for quality-aware feature extraction.\nSpecifically, we first reformulate the quality regression problem into a\nquestion and answering (Q&A) task and construct Q&A prompts for VQA instruction\ntuning. Then, we design a spatiotemporal vision encoder to extract spatial and\ntemporal features to represent the quality characteristics of videos, which are\nsubsequently mapped into the language space by the spatiotemporal projector for\nmodality alignment. Finally, the aligned visual tokens and the quality-inquired\ntext tokens are aggregated as inputs for the large language model (LLM) to\ngenerate the quality score and level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLMM-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance across five VQA benchmarks,\nexhibiting an average improvement of $5\\%$ in generalization ability over\nexisting methods. Furthermore, due to the advanced design of the spatiotemporal\nencoder and projector, LMM-VQA also performs exceptionally well on general\nvideo understanding tasks, further validating its effectiveness.

Specifically, at the transmitter,\ndescription and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are\nextracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics,\nrespectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are\nutilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing\nthe video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel\nbandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to\nreconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different\nsignal-to-noise ratios.

Recently, multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) have shown great potential in image quality assessment (IQA) and\nimage aesthetic assessment (IAA).

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\ndataset, named Realistic image Quality and Aesthetic (RealQA), including 14,715\nUGC images, each of which is annoted with 10 fine-grained attributes. These\nattributes span three levels: low level (e.g., image clarity), middle level\n(e.g., subject integrity) and high level (e.g., composition). Besides, we\nconduct a series of in-depth and comprehensive investigations into how to\neffectively predict numerical scores using MLLMs. Surprisingly, by predicting\njust two extra significant digits, the next token paradigm can achieve SOTA\nperformance. Furthermore, with the help of chain of thought (CoT) combined with\nthe learnt fine-grained attributes, the proposed method can outperform SOTA\nmethods on five public datasets for IQA and IAA with superior interpretability\nand show strong zero-shot generalization for video quality assessment (VQA).\nThe code and dataset will be released.",

            "abstract": "The highly abstract nature of image aesthetics perception (IAP) poses\nsignificant challenge for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The\nlack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this\ndilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception\ncapabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a\ncomprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT)\ndataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics\nfoundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics\nperception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904\ndiverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are\ncollected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic\ngrades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle\ndiverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and\nassemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT,\nwhich consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic\ncapabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced\ngeneral foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models,\ndubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert\nmodels deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and\nGemini-Pro-Vision.

Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main\ncategories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to\nevaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack\nalignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based\nbenchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a\nlimited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To\naddress these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with\nhuman preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfeaturing a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This\nbenchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across\nall dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By\nincorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench\nprovides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation.\nExperiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench\nachieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions.\nMoreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human\nevaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights,\nsuggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.",

In response, we\npropose the DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It\ninvolves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into $mN$\nones and activating $mK$ from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of\nactivated experts; (2) isolating $K_s$ experts as shared ones, aiming at\ncapturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts.\nStarting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that\nDeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5\ntimes the expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly\napproaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of\ntotal parameters, which set the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we\nscale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable\nperformance with LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations. Further, our\npreliminary efforts to scale up DeepSeekMoE to 145B parameters consistently\nvalidate its substantial advantages over the GShard architecture, and show its\nperformance comparable with DeepSeek 67B, using only 28.5% (maybe even 18.2%)\nof computations.",

In this\nwork, we systematically investigate the scaling laws of synthetic data by\nintroducing SynthLLM, a scalable framework that transforms pre-training corpora\ninto diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets. Our approach achieves this by\nautomatically extracting and recombining high-level concepts across multiple\ndocuments using a graph algorithm. Key findings from our extensive mathematical\nexperiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that\nreliably adheres to the rectified scaling law across various model sizes; (2)\nPerformance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models\napproach optimal performance with fewer training tokens. For instance, an 8B\nmodel peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T. Moreover, comparisons\nwith existing synthetic data generation and augmentation methods demonstrate\nthat SynthLLM achieves superior performance and scalability.

When the transfer gap is low, pre-training is a\ncost-effective strategy for improving downstream performance.

To address these issues, we\npresent two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely\nLing-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as \"Bailing\" in Chinese, spelled\nB\\v{a}il\\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75\nbillion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters\nwith 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable\nperformance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable\ninsights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in\nresource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable\ntechnologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE\nmodels, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model\narchitecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly\nhandling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally,\nleveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models\ndemonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models.\nUltimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be\neffectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable\nperformance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models.\nCompared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware\nsystem during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings,\nreducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

In response, we\npropose the DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It\ninvolves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into $mN$\nones and activating $mK$ from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of\nactivated experts; (2) isolating $K_s$ experts as shared ones, aiming at\ncapturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts.\nStarting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that\nDeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5\ntimes the expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly\napproaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of\ntotal parameters, which set the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we\nscale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable\nperformance with LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations. Further, our\npreliminary efforts to scale up DeepSeekMoE to 145B parameters consistently\nvalidate its substantial advantages over the GShard architecture, and show its\nperformance comparable with DeepSeek 67B, using only 28.5% (maybe even 18.2%)\nof computations.",

Through\nextensive experiments, we identify empirical scaling laws that describe how\nperformance depends on dataset size and model configuration.

To address these issues, we\npresent two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely\nLing-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as \"Bailing\" in Chinese, spelled\nB\\v{a}il\\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75\nbillion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters\nwith 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable\nperformance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable\ninsights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in\nresource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable\ntechnologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE\nmodels, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model\narchitecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly\nhandling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally,\nleveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models\ndemonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models.\nUltimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be\neffectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable\nperformance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models.\nCompared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware\nsystem during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings,\nreducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

Previous approaches have primarily utilized\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) via online RL methods such as\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Recently, offline methods such as Sequence\nLikelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nemerged as attractive alternatives, offering improvements in stability and\nscalability while maintaining competitive performance. SLiC refines its loss\nfunction using sequence pairs sampled from a supervised fine-tuned (SFT)\npolicy, while DPO directly optimizes language models based on preference data,\nforegoing the need for a separate reward model. However, the maximum likelihood\nestimator (MLE) of the target optimal policy requires labeled preference pairs\nsampled from that policy. DPO's lack of a reward model constrains its ability\nto sample preference pairs from the optimal policy, and SLiC is restricted to\nsampling preference pairs only from the SFT policy. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel approach called Statistical Rejection\nSampling Optimization (RSO) that aims to source preference data from the target\noptimal policy using rejection sampling, enabling a more accurate estimation of\nthe optimal policy. We also propose a unified framework that enhances the loss\nfunctions used in both SLiC and DPO from a preference modeling standpoint.\nThrough extensive experiments across three diverse tasks, we demonstrate that\nRSO consistently outperforms both SLiC and DPO on evaluations from both Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) and human raters.",

            "abstract": "While generative AI excels in content generation, it does not always increase\nuser engagement. This can be attributed to two main factors. First, generative\nAI generates content without incorporating explicit or implicit feedback about\nuser interactions. Even if the generated content seems to be more informative\nor well-written, it does not necessarily lead to an increase in user\nactivities, such as clicks. Second, there is a concern with the quality of the\ncontent generative AI produces, which often lacks the distinctiveness and\nauthenticity that human-created content possesses. These two factors can lead\nto content that fails to meet specific needs and preferences of users,\nultimately reducing its potential to be engaging.\n  This paper presents a generic framework of how to improve user engagement\nwith generative AI by leveraging user feedback. Our solutions employ rejection\nsampling, a technique used in reinforcement learning, to boost engagement\nmetrics. We leveraged the framework in the context of email notification\nsubject lines generation for an online social network, and achieved significant\nengagement metric lift including +1% Session and +0.4% Weekly Active Users. We\nbelieve our work offers a universal framework that enhances user engagement\nwith generative AI, particularly when standard generative AI reaches its limits\nin terms of enhancing content to be more captivating. To the best of our\nknowledge, this represents an early milestone in the industry's successful use\nof generative AI to enhance user engagement.",

Previous approaches have primarily utilized\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) via online RL methods such as\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Recently, offline methods such as Sequence\nLikelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nemerged as attractive alternatives, offering improvements in stability and\nscalability while maintaining competitive performance. SLiC refines its loss\nfunction using sequence pairs sampled from a supervised fine-tuned (SFT)\npolicy, while DPO directly optimizes language models based on preference data,\nforegoing the need for a separate reward model. However, the maximum likelihood\nestimator (MLE) of the target optimal policy requires labeled preference pairs\nsampled from that policy. DPO's lack of a reward model constrains its ability\nto sample preference pairs from the optimal policy, and SLiC is restricted to\nsampling preference pairs only from the SFT policy. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel approach called Statistical Rejection\nSampling Optimization (RSO) that aims to source preference data from the target\noptimal policy using rejection sampling, enabling a more accurate estimation of\nthe optimal policy. We also propose a unified framework that enhances the loss\nfunctions used in both SLiC and DPO from a preference modeling standpoint.\nThrough extensive experiments across three diverse tasks, we demonstrate that\nRSO consistently outperforms both SLiC and DPO on evaluations from both Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) and human raters.",

Previous works usually\nsynthesize data from proprietary models to augment existing datasets, followed\nby instruction tuning to achieve top-tier results. However, our analysis of\nthese datasets reveals severe biases towards easy queries, with frequent\nfailures to generate any correct response for the most challenging queries.\nHypothesizing that difficult queries are crucial to learn complex reasoning, we\npropose Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning (DART), a method that allocates\ndifficult queries more trials during the synthesis phase, enabling more\nextensive training on difficult samples. Utilizing DART, we have created new\ndatasets for mathematical problem-solving that focus more on difficult queries\nand are substantially smaller than previous ones. Remarkably, our synthesis\nprocess solely relies on a 7B-sized open-weight model, without reliance on the\ncommonly used proprietary GPT-4.

Crucially, beyond selecting a\nsingle optimal response, the model must also develop robust self-correction\ncapabilities within its own outputs.

In this paper, we investigate how the pre-training loss,\nsupervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the reasoning\nperformances of a supervised LLM. We find that pre-training loss is a better\nindicator of the model's performance than the model's parameter count. We apply\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with different amounts of supervised data and\nempirically find a log-linear relation between data amount and model\nperformance, and we find better models improve less with enlarged supervised\ndatasets. To augment more data samples for improving model performances without\nany human effort, we propose to apply Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). RFT\nuses supervised models to generate and collect correct reasoning paths as\naugmented fine-tuning datasets. We find with augmented samples containing more\ndistinct reasoning paths, RFT improves mathematical reasoning performance more\nfor LLMs. We also find RFT brings more improvement for less performant LLMs.\nFurthermore, we combine rejection samples from multiple models which push\nLLaMA-7B to an accuracy of 49.3\\% on GSM8K which outperforms the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) accuracy of 35.9\\% significantly.",

Recent advancements in pre-trained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are opening new avenues for generating visualizations\nfrom natural language. However, the lack of a comprehensive and reliable\nbenchmark hinders our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in visualization\ngeneration. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a new NL2VIS\nbenchmark called VisEval. Firstly, we introduce a high-quality and large-scale\ndataset. This dataset includes 2,524 representative queries covering 146\ndatabases, paired with accurately labeled ground truths. Secondly, we advocate\nfor a comprehensive automated evaluation methodology covering multiple\ndimensions, including validity, legality, and readability. By systematically\nscanning for potential issues with a number of heterogeneous checkers, VisEval\nprovides reliable and trustworthy evaluation outcomes. We run VisEval on a\nseries of state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals prevalent challenges\nand delivers essential insights for future advancements.",

            "abstract": "Performance gap across classes remains a persistent challenge in machine\nlearning, often attributed to variations in class hardness. One way to quantify\nclass hardness is through sample complexity - the minimum number of samples\nrequired to effectively learn a given class. Sample complexity theory suggests\nthat class hardness is driven by differences in the amount of data required for\ngeneralization. That is, harder classes need substantially more samples to\nachieve generalization. Therefore, hardness-based resampling is a promising\napproach to mitigate these performance disparities. While resampling has been\nstudied extensively in data-imbalanced settings, its impact on balanced\ndatasets remains unexplored.\n  This raises the fundamental question whether resampling is effective because\nit addresses data imbalance or hardness imbalance. We begin addressing this\nquestion by introducing class imbalance into balanced datasets and evaluate its\neffect on performance disparities. We oversample hard classes and undersample\neasy classes to bring hard classes closer to their sample complexity\nrequirements while maintaining a constant dataset size for fairness. We\nestimate class-level hardness using the Area Under the Margin (AUM) hardness\nestimator and leverage it to compute resampling ratios. Using these ratios, we\nperform hardness-based resampling on the well-known CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\ndatasets.\n  Contrary to theoretical expectations, our results show that hardness-based\nresampling does not meaningfully affect class-wise performance disparities. To\nexplain this discrepancy, we conduct detailed analyses to identify key\nchallenges unique to hardness-based imbalance, distinguishing it from\ntraditional data-based imbalance. Our insights help explain why theoretical\nsample complexity expectations fail to translate into practical performance\ngains and we provide guidelines for future research.",

            "abstract": "LLMs have become the go-to choice for code generation tasks, with an\nexponential increase in the training, development, and usage of LLMs\nspecifically for code generation. To evaluate the ability of LLMs on code, both\nacademic and industry practitioners rely on popular handcrafted benchmarks.\nHowever, prior benchmarks contain only a very limited set of problems, both in\nquantity and variety. Further, due to popularity and age, many benchmarks are\nprone to data leakage where example solutions can be readily found on the web\nand thus potentially in training data. Such limitations inevitably lead us to\ninquire: Is the leaderboard performance on existing benchmarks reliable and\ncomprehensive enough to measure the program synthesis ability of LLMs? To\naddress this, we introduce EvoEval -- a program synthesis benchmark suite\ncreated by evolving existing benchmarks into different targeted domains for a\ncomprehensive evaluation of LLM coding abilities. Our study on 51 LLMs shows\nthat compared to the high performance obtained on standard benchmarks like\nHumanEval, there is a significant drop in performance (on average 39.4%) when\nusing EvoEval. Additionally, the decrease in performance can range from 19.6%\nto 47.7%, leading to drastic ranking changes amongst LLMs and showing potential\noverfitting of existing benchmarks. Furthermore, we showcase various insights,\nincluding the brittleness of instruction-following models when encountering\nrewording or subtle changes as well as the importance of learning problem\ncomposition and decomposition. EvoEval not only provides comprehensive\nbenchmarks, but can be used to further evolve arbitrary problems to keep up\nwith advances and the ever-changing landscape of LLMs for code.

NCB comprises 402\nhigh-quality problems in Python and Java, meticulously selected from natural\nuser queries from online coding services, covering 6 different domains.

Second, a case analysis is conducted on the LLM that\nshowed the highest performance, focusing on the quality and accuracy of its\nanswers through manual evaluation.

To bridge this gap, we take the first step to conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of ChatGPT in generating pre-university math questions.

Applying RLVR to the base model\nQwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance\non MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six\ncommon mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result\nmatches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500:\n73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar\nsubstantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B,\nLlama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and\nPPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or\ngreater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In\naddition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including\ncross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and\nsustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has\nsaturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we\nverify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy\ngradient loss, distinguishing it from the \"grokking\" phenomenon. We also show\nthe critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with\nan appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe\nthat applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly\nenhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%. These findings\ncan inspire future work on RLVR data efficiency and encourage a re-examination\nof both recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR.

To achieve this, we first\nextend the original AlphaGeometry language to tackle harder problems involving\nmovements of objects, and problems containing linear equations of angles,\nratios, and distances. This, together with support for non-constructive\nproblems, has markedly improved the coverage rate of the AlphaGeometry language\non International Math Olympiads (IMO) 2000-2024 geometry problems from 66% to\n88%. The search process of AlphaGeometry2 has also been greatly improved\nthrough the use of Gemini architecture for better language modeling, and a\nnovel knowledge-sharing mechanism that enables effective communication between\nsearch trees. Together with further enhancements to the symbolic engine and\nsynthetic data generation, we have significantly boosted the overall solving\nrate of AlphaGeometry2 to 84% for $\\textit{all}$ geometry problems over the\nlast 25 years, compared to 54% previously. AlphaGeometry2 was also part of the\nsystem that achieved silver-medal standard at IMO 2024\nhttps://dpmd.ai/imo-silver.

Within this formal\nframework, we have been able to seamlessly integrate modern AI models with our\nformal system. AI is now capable of providing deductive reasoning solutions to\nIMO-level plane geometry problems, just like handling other natural languages,\nand these proofs are readable, traceable, and verifiable. We propose the\ngeometry formalization theory (GFT) to guide the development of the geometry\nformal system. Based on the GFT, we have established the FormalGeo, which\nconsists of 88 geometric predicates and 196 theorems. It can represent,\nvalidate, and solve IMO-level geometry problems. we also have crafted the FGPS\n(formal geometry problem solver) in Python. It serves as both an interactive\nassistant for verifying problem-solving processes and an automated problem\nsolver. We've annotated the formalgeo7k and formalgeo-imo datasets.

In this survey, we categorize TTA\ninto several distinct groups based on the form of test data, namely, test-time\ndomain adaptation, test-time batch adaptation, and online test-time adaptation.\nFor each category, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of advanced algorithms\nand discuss various learning scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze relevant\napplications of TTA and discuss open challenges and promising areas for future\nresearch.

Because only well-resourced\ncorporations can train frontier LLMs, we need robust test-time strategies to\ncontrol such biases. Existing solutions, which instruct the LLM to be fair or\nrobust, rely on the model's implicit understanding of bias. Causality provides\na rich formalism through which we can be explicit about our debiasing\nrequirements. Yet, as we show, a naive application of the standard causal\ndebiasing strategy, counterfactual data augmentation, fails under standard\nassumptions to debias predictions at an individual level at test time. To\naddress this, we develop a stratified notion of debiasing called stratified\ninvariance, which can capture a range of debiasing requirements from population\nlevel to individual level through an additional measurement that stratifies the\npredictions. We present a complete observational test for stratified\ninvariance. Finally, we introduce a data augmentation strategy that guarantees\nstratified invariance at test time under suitable assumptions, together with a\nprompting strategy that encourages stratified invariance in LLMs. We show that\nour prompting strategy, unlike implicit instructions, consistently reduces the\nbias of frontier LLMs across a suite of synthetic and real-world benchmarks\nwithout requiring additional data, finetuning or pre-training.",

To mitigate this challenge, Test-Time\nTraining (TTT) has been proposed as a promising approach. Traditional TTT\nmethods require a demanding unsupervised training strategy to capture the\ninformation from test to benefit the main task. Inspired by the great\nannotation ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Text-Attributed Graphs\n(TAGs), we propose to enhance the test-time training on graphs with LLMs as\nannotators. In this paper, we design a novel Test-Time Training pipeline,\nLLMTTT, which conducts the test-time adaptation under the annotations by LLMs\non a carefully-selected node set. Specifically, LLMTTT introduces a hybrid\nactive node selection strategy that considers not only node diversity and\nrepresentativeness, but also prediction signals from the pre-trained model.\nGiven annotations from LLMs, a two-stage training strategy is designed to\ntailor the test-time model with the limited and noisy labels. A theoretical\nanalysis ensures the validity of our method and extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed LLMTTT can achieve a significant performance\nimprovement compared to existing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization\nmethods.",

However,\nthe effectiveness of mechanisms like self-reflection and self-correction\ndepends on the model's capacity to accurately assess its own performance, which\ncan be limited by factors such as initial accuracy, question difficulty, and\nthe lack of external feedback. In this paper, we delve into a two-player\nparadigm that separates the roles of reasoning and critique models, where the\ncritique model provides step-level feedback to supervise the reasoning (actor)\nmodel during both test-time and train-time. We first propose AutoMathCritique,\nan automated and scalable framework for collecting critique data, resulting in\na dataset of $76,321$ responses paired with step-level feedback. Fine-tuning\nlanguage models with this dataset enables them to generate natural language\nfeedback for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate that the critique models\nconsistently improve the actor's performance on difficult queries at test-time,\nespecially when scaling up inference-time computation. Motivated by these\nfindings, we introduce the critique-based supervision to the actor's\nself-training process, and propose a critique-in-the-loop self-improvement\nmethod. Experiments show that the method improves the actor's exploration\nefficiency and solution diversity, especially on challenging queries, leading\nto a stronger reasoning model. Lastly, we take the preliminary step to explore\ntraining self-talk reasoning models via critique supervision and showcase its\npotential.

To address this,\nwe introduce SIFT, a data selection algorithm designed to reduce uncertainty\nabout the model's response given a prompt, which unifies ideas from retrieval\nand active learning. Whereas Nearest Neighbor retrieval typically fails in the\npresence of information duplication, SIFT accounts for information duplication\nand optimizes the overall information gain of the selected examples. We focus\nour evaluations on fine-tuning at test-time for prompt-specific language\nmodeling on the Pile dataset, and show that SIFT consistently outperforms\nNearest Neighbor retrieval, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, we\nshow that our uncertainty estimates can predict the performance gain of\ntest-time fine-tuning, and use this to develop an adaptive algorithm that\ninvests test-time compute proportional to realized performance gains. We\nprovide the $\\texttt{activeft}$ (Active Fine-Tuning) library which can be used\nas a drop-in replacement for Nearest Neighbor retrieval.",

In this paper, we study the scaling of\ninference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if\nan LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time\ncompute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?\nAnswering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance\nof LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff\ninference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little\nresearch attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time\ninference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for\na number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms\nto scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based\nverifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a\nresponse adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,\nthe effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute\ncritically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation\nmotivates applying a \"compute-optimal\" scaling strategy, which acts to most\neffectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this\ncompute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute\nscaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a\nFLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model\nattains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to\noutperform a 14x larger model.",

We close much of this theory/practice gap, and as a\nconsequence are able to derive new problem-adaptive learning rate schedules.\nOur main technical contribution is a refined analysis of learning rate\nschedules for a wide class of optimization algorithms (including SGD). When\nconsidering only worst-case analysis, our theory predicts that the optimal\nchoice is the linear decay schedule where the step-size is set proportional to\n1 - t/T, where t is the current iteration and T is the total number of steps.\nTo go beyond this worst-case analysis, we use the observed gradient norms to\nderive schedules refined for any particular task. These refined schedules\nexhibit learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate annealing near the end of\ntraining. Ours is the first systematic approach to automatically yield both of\nthese properties. We perform the most comprehensive evaluation of learning rate\nschedules to date, evaluating across 10 diverse deep learning problems, a\nseries of LLMs, and a suite of logistic regression problems. We validate that\noverall, the linear-decay schedule outperforms all commonly used default\nschedules including cosine annealing.

We\ninvestigate the training behavior of a direct alternative -- constant learning\nrate and cooldowns -- and find that it scales predictably and reliably similar\nto cosine. Additionally, we show that stochastic weight averaging yields\nimproved performance along the training trajectory, without additional training\ncosts, across different scales.

To address these issues, we propose the\nfollowing contributions: 1) We trained a robust baseline model using the latest\nadvancements in vision-language models, introducing effective improvements and\nconducting comprehensive ablation and validation for each technique. 2)\nInspired by recent work on large language models, we filtered pre-training data\nusing perplexity, selecting the lowest perplexity data for training.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention\nas a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from\nconstructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in\nresponses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data\nconstruction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We\nidentify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the\nconstructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by\nthe presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference\npolicy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically\nsummarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address\nhallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment\n(OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct\nhallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised\nresponses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO\nachieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B:\n13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared\nto the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.

These challenges necessitate advanced\npost-training language models (PoLMs) to address these shortcomings, such as\nOpenAI-o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1 (collectively known as Large Reasoning Models, or\nLRMs). This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of PoLMs,\nsystematically tracing their evolution across five core paradigms: Fine-tuning,\nwhich enhances task-specific accuracy; Alignment, which ensures alignment with\nhuman preferences; Reasoning, which advances multi-step inference despite\nchallenges in reward design; Efficiency, which optimizes resource utilization\namidst increasing complexity; and Integration and Adaptation, which extend\ncapabilities across diverse modalities while addressing coherence issues.\nCharting progress from ChatGPT's foundational alignment strategies to\nDeepSeek-R1's innovative reasoning advancements, we illustrate how PoLMs\nleverage datasets to mitigate biases, deepen reasoning capabilities, and\nenhance domain adaptability. Our contributions include a pioneering synthesis\nof PoLM evolution, a structured taxonomy categorizing techniques and datasets,\nand a strategic agenda emphasizing the role of LRMs in improving reasoning\nproficiency and domain flexibility.

However, existing training\nparadigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality\nimage-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the\navailability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce\nand saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.\nThis study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for\nvision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale\nlow-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a\nviable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)\nachieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language\nmodels through empirical validation. This paper presents three key\ncontributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,\nlow-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO\nmethodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,\nthe non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.2%\nto 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals\nthat our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their\ncounterparts. Across 35 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data\nachieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to alt-text\npairs and other previous work. Meanwhile, it also offers considerable support\nin the text-to-image domain. With our dataset, the FID score is reduced by 17.1\non a real-world validation benchmark and 13.3 on the MSCOCO validation\nbenchmark. 3) We will release Hunyuan-Recap100M, a low-hallucination and\nknowledge-intensive synthetic caption dataset.",

However, the\nhigh computational cost of existing approaches hinders their applications in\nrealistic chemistry problems. Here, we report the development of a new NN-VMC\nmethod that achieves a remarkable speed-up by more than one order of magnitude,\nthereby greatly extending the applicability of NN-VMC to larger systems. Our\nkey design is a novel computational framework named Forward Laplacian, which\ncomputes the Laplacian associated with neural networks, the bottleneck of\nNN-VMC, through an efficient forward propagation process. We then demonstrate\nthat Forward Laplacian is not only versatile but also facilitates more\ndevelopments of acceleration methods across various aspects, including\noptimization for sparse derivative matrix and efficient neural network design.\nEmpirically, our approach enables NN-VMC to investigate a broader range of\natoms, molecules and chemical reactions for the first time, providing valuable\nreferences to other ab initio methods. The results demonstrate a great\npotential in applying deep learning methods to solve general quantum mechanical\nproblems.",

A leading method towards\nachieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially quantum\ngenerative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum\nmechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative learning\nmodels (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such, QGLMs are\nreceiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science\ncommunities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on\nnear-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are\nproposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the\nperspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs,\ncovering quantum circuit born machines, quantum generative adversarial\nnetworks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum autoencoders, as the quantum\nextension of classical generative learning models. In this context, we explore\ntheir intrinsic relation and their fundamental differences. We further\nsummarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional machine\nlearning tasks and quantum physics. Last, we discuss the challenges and further\nresearch directions for QGLMs.",

To bridge the gap between accurate QC and\ncondensed-phase Molecular Dynamics, we leverage transfer learning to improve\nthe DFT-based FeNNix-Bio1 foundation model. The resulting approach is coupled\nto path integrals adaptive sampling quantum dynamics to perform nanosecond\nreactive simulations at unprecedented accuracy.

A leading method towards\nachieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially quantum\ngenerative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum\nmechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative learning\nmodels (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such, QGLMs are\nreceiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science\ncommunities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on\nnear-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are\nproposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the\nperspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs,\ncovering quantum circuit born machines, quantum generative adversarial\nnetworks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum autoencoders, as the quantum\nextension of classical generative learning models. In this context, we explore\ntheir intrinsic relation and their fundamental differences. We further\nsummarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional machine\nlearning tasks and quantum physics.

In this paper, we investigate\nthe vulnerability of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models to adversarial\nattacks and propose a new attack algorithm called TransFool. To fool NMT\nmodels, TransFool builds on a multi-term optimization problem and a gradient\nprojection step. By integrating the embedding representation of a language\nmodel, we generate fluent adversarial examples in the source language that\nmaintain a high level of semantic similarity with the clean samples.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, for different translation tasks and NMT\narchitectures, our white-box attack can severely degrade the translation\nquality while the semantic similarity between the original and the adversarial\nsentences stays high. Moreover, we show that TransFool is transferable to\nunknown target models. Finally, based on automatic and human evaluations,\nTransFool leads to improvement in terms of success rate, semantic similarity,\nand fluency compared to the existing attacks both in white-box and black-box\nsettings. Thus, TransFool permits us to better characterize the vulnerability\nof NMT models and outlines the necessity to design strong defense mechanisms\nand more robust NMT systems for real-life applications.",

Fortunately,\nstandard attacking methods generate adversarial texts in a pair-wise way, that\nis, an adversarial text can only be created from a real-world text by replacing\na few words. In many applications, these texts are limited in numbers,\ntherefore their corresponding adversarial examples are often not diverse enough\nand sometimes hard to read, thus can be easily detected by humans and cannot\ncreate chaos at a large scale. In this paper, we propose an end to end solution\nto efficiently generate adversarial texts from scratch using generative models,\nwhich are not restricted to perturbing the given texts. We call it unrestricted\nadversarial text generation. Specifically, we train a conditional variational\nautoencoder (VAE) with an additional adversarial loss to guide the generation\nof adversarial examples. Moreover, to improve the validity of adversarial\ntexts, we utilize discrimators and the training framework of generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) to make adversarial texts consistent with real\ndata. Experimental results on sentiment analysis demonstrate the scalability\nand efficiency of our method. It can attack text classification models with a\nhigher success rate than existing methods, and provide acceptable quality for\nhumans in the meantime.",

We term such tokens as Scaffold Tokens. Due to their infrequent\noccurrences in the text corpus, Scaffold Tokens pose a learning imbalance\nissue. To address that issue, we propose Scaffold-BPE, which incorporates a\ndynamic scaffold token removal mechanism by parameter-free, computation-light,\nand easy-to-implement modifications to the original BPE method. This novel\napproach ensures the exclusion of low-frequency Scaffold Tokens from the token\nrepresentations for given texts, thereby mitigating the issue of frequency\nimbalance and facilitating model training.

In addressing the vulnerability of text classifiers to adversarial\nattacks, three distinct attack mechanisms are explored in this paper using the\nvictim model BERT: BERT-on-BERT attack, PWWS attack, and Fraud Bargain's Attack\n(FBA). Leveraging the IMDB, AG News, and SST2 datasets, a thorough comparative\nanalysis is conducted to assess the effectiveness of these attacks on the BERT\nclassifier model. It is revealed by the analysis that PWWS emerges as the most\npotent adversary, consistently outperforming other methods across multiple\nevaluation scenarios, thereby emphasizing its efficacy in generating\nadversarial examples for text classification. Through comprehensive\nexperimentation, the performance of these attacks is assessed and the findings\nindicate that the PWWS attack outperforms others, demonstrating lower runtime,\nhigher accuracy, and favorable semantic similarity scores.

While diffusion-based modeling approaches have shown promise,\nthey often struggle to maintain object and scene consistency, especially in\ncomplex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an\nautoregressive generative approach called Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS)\nmodeling, which uses local patch quantization and randomly ordered sequence\ngeneration. By utilizing optical flow as an intermediate representation for 3D\nscene editing, our experiments demonstrate that LRAS achieves state-of-the-art\nnovel view synthesis and 3D object manipulation capabilities. Furthermore, we\nshow that our framework naturally extends to self-supervised depth estimation\nthrough a simple modification of the sequence design.

Due to the high density\nof visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating\ntask-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to\nsegment all objects and consider their features as scene representations.\nHowever, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information\nand missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we\npropose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies\ntask-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks,\nfollowed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained\ndetails in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the\nattention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input.\nIt then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive\nself-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected\nfine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene\nunderstanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room\nunderstanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene\nunderstanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption.\nExperiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene\nunderstanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene\nmagnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.",

Recently, this success has been extended to 3D AIGC,\nwith state-of-the-art methods generating textured 3D models from single images\nor text. However, we argue that current 3D AIGC methods still do not fully\nunleash human creativity. We often imagine 3D content made from multimodal\ninputs, such as what it would look like if my pet bunny were eating a doughnut\non the table. In this paper, we explore a novel 3D AIGC approach: generating 3D\ncontent from IDEAs. An IDEA is a multimodal input composed of text, image, and\n3D models. To our knowledge, this challenging and exciting 3D AIGC setting has\nnot been studied before. We propose the new framework Idea23D, which combines\nthree agents based on large multimodal models (LMMs) and existing algorithmic\ntools. These three LMM-based agents are tasked with prompt generation, model\nselection, and feedback reflection. They collaborate and critique each other in\na fully automated loop, without human intervention. The framework then\ngenerates a text prompt to create 3D models that align closely with the input\nIDEAs. We demonstrate impressive 3D AIGC results that surpass previous methods.\nTo comprehensively assess the 3D AIGC capabilities of Idea23D, we introduce the\nEval3DAIGC-198 dataset, containing 198 multimodal inputs for 3D generation\ntasks. This dataset evaluates the alignment between generated 3D content and\ninput IDEAs. Our user study and quantitative results show that Idea23D\nsignificantly improves the success rate and accuracy of 3D generation, with\nexcellent compatibility across various LMM, Text-to-Image, and Image-to-3D\nmodels.

This growth encompasses not just the creation of 3D objects, but\nalso the rapid development of 3D character and motion generation. Several key\nfactors contribute to this progress.

This requires the reconstruction\nof a 3D scene from an input image (or a set of multi-view images), whereby the\ncontents of the image(s) are causally explained in terms of models of\ninstantiated objects, each with their own type, shape, appearance and pose,\nalong with global variables like scene lighting and camera parameters. This\napproach also requires scene models which account for the co-occurrences and\ninter-relationships of objects in a scene. The SGM approach has the merits that\nit is compositional and generative, which lead to interpretability and\neditability. \\\\\\\\ To pursue the SGM agenda, we need models for objects and\nscenes, and approaches to carry out inference. We first review models for\nobjects, which include ``things'' (object categories that have a well defined\nshape), and ``stuff'' (categories which have amorphous spatial extent). We then\nmove on to review \\emph{scene models} which describe the inter-relationships of\nobjects. Perhaps the most challenging problem for SGMs is \\emph{inference} of\nthe objects, lighting and camera parameters, and scene inter-relationships from\ninput consisting of a single or multiple images. We conclude with a discussion\nof issues that need addressing to advance the SGM agenda.",

Due to the high density\nof visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating\ntask-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to\nsegment all objects and consider their features as scene representations.\nHowever, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information\nand missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we\npropose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies\ntask-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks,\nfollowed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained\ndetails in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the\nattention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input.\nIt then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive\nself-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected\nfine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene\nunderstanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room\nunderstanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene\nunderstanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption.\nExperiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene\nunderstanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks.

Since the\nyear 2023 an abundant amount of research papers has emerged in the domain of 3D\ngeneration. This growth encompasses not just the creation of 3D objects, but\nalso the rapid development of 3D character and motion generation. Several key\nfactors contribute to this progress. The enhanced fidelity in stable diffusion,\ncoupled with control methods that ensure multi-view consistency, and realistic\nhuman models like SMPL-X, contribute synergistically to the production of 3D\nmodels with remarkable consistency and near-realistic appearances. The\nadvancements in neural network-based 3D storing and rendering models, such as\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have\naccelerated the efficiency and realism of neural rendered models. Furthermore,\nthe multimodality capabilities of large language models have enabled language\ninputs to transcend into human motion outputs. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive overview and summary of the relevant papers published mostly\nduring the latter half year of 2023. It will begin by discussing the AI\ngenerated object models in 3D, followed by the generated 3D human models, and\nfinally, the generated 3D human motions, culminating in a conclusive summary\nand a vision for the future.",

Recently, this success has been extended to 3D AIGC,\nwith state-of-the-art methods generating textured 3D models from single images\nor text. However, we argue that current 3D AIGC methods still do not fully\nunleash human creativity. We often imagine 3D content made from multimodal\ninputs, such as what it would look like if my pet bunny were eating a doughnut\non the table. In this paper, we explore a novel 3D AIGC approach: generating 3D\ncontent from IDEAs. An IDEA is a multimodal input composed of text, image, and\n3D models. To our knowledge, this challenging and exciting 3D AIGC setting has\nnot been studied before. We propose the new framework Idea23D, which combines\nthree agents based on large multimodal models (LMMs) and existing algorithmic\ntools. These three LMM-based agents are tasked with prompt generation, model\nselection, and feedback reflection. They collaborate and critique each other in\na fully automated loop, without human intervention. The framework then\ngenerates a text prompt to create 3D models that align closely with the input\nIDEAs. We demonstrate impressive 3D AIGC results that surpass previous methods.\nTo comprehensively assess the 3D AIGC capabilities of Idea23D, we introduce the\nEval3DAIGC-198 dataset, containing 198 multimodal inputs for 3D generation\ntasks. This dataset evaluates the alignment between generated 3D content and\ninput IDEAs. Our user study and quantitative results show that Idea23D\nsignificantly improves the success rate and accuracy of 3D generation, with\nexcellent compatibility across various LMM, Text-to-Image, and Image-to-3D\nmodels.

Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more\ncompute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,\ngenerally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost\nof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it\nimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a\nlightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several\ncomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)\nlow-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a\ndowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)\ncheckpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,\nleading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen\nas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model\ncan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied\nacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices\nquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with\nmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families\nand validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method\noutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the\nsame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.\nSpecifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of\nmemory.

            "abstract": "An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale\npre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or\ndomains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all\nmodel parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example --\ndeploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B\nparameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or\nLoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank\ndecomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly\nreducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to\nGPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable\nparameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA\nperforms on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa,\nDeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher\ntraining throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We\nalso provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model\nadaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package\nthat facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our\nimplementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.",

To ensure stability, the framework\nintegrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy\ncomparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to\n13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens.

Structured pruning is an effective approach\nto reducing model size, but it often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation, necessitating parameter updates to adapt. Unfortunately, such\nfine-tuning requires substantial memory, which limits its applicability. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce quantization into the structured pruning\nframework to reduce memory consumption during both fine-tuning and inference.\nHowever, the combined errors from pruning and quantization increase the\ndifficulty of fine-tuning, requiring a more refined quantization scheme. To\nthis end, we propose QPruner, a novel framework that employs structured pruning\nto reduce model size, followed by a layer-wise mixed-precision quantization\nscheme. Quantization precisions are assigned to each layer based on their\nimportance to the target task, and Bayesian optimization is employed to refine\nprecision allocation strategies, ensuring a balance between model accuracy and\nmemory efficiency.

Quantization\ntechniques, which reduce the bits needed for model weights or activations with\nminimal performance loss, have become popular due to the rise of LLMs. However,\nmost quantization studies use pre-trained LLMs, and the impact of quantization\non instruction-tuned LLMs and the relationship between perplexity and benchmark\nperformance of quantized LLMs are not well understood. Evaluation of quantized\nLLMs is often limited to language modeling and a few classification tasks,\nleaving their performance on other benchmarks unclear. To address these gaps,\nwe propose a structured evaluation framework consisting of three critical\ndimensions: (1) knowledge \\& capacity, (2) alignment, and (3) efficiency, and\nconduct extensive experiments across ten diverse benchmarks. Our experimental\nresults indicate that LLMs with 4-bit quantization can retain performance\ncomparable to their non-quantized counterparts, and perplexity can serve as a\nproxy metric for quantized LLMs on most benchmarks. Furthermore, quantized LLMs\nwith larger parameter scales can outperform smaller LLMs. Despite the memory\nsavings achieved through quantization, it can also slow down the inference\nspeed of LLMs. Consequently, substantial engineering efforts and hardware\nsupport are imperative to achieve a balanced optimization of decoding speed and\nmemory consumption in the context of quantized LLMs.",

The static distribution attempts to encompass all\npossible input distributions, thus fitting none of them particularly well.

Our method achieves a Bj{\\o}ntegaard-Delta (BD)-rate\ngain of -7.10% on the Kodak test dataset when applied to the standard\nfully-factorized architecture.

Two key components of learned image compression are the\nentropy model of the latent representations and the encoding/decoding network\narchitectures. Various models have been proposed, such as autoregressive,\nsoftmax, logistic mixture, Gaussian mixture, and Laplacian. Existing schemes\nonly use one of these models. However, due to the vast diversity of images, it\nis not optimal to use one model for all images, even different regions within\none image. In this paper, we propose a more flexible discretized\nGaussian-Laplacian-Logistic mixture model (GLLMM) for the latent\nrepresentations, which can adapt to different contents in different images and\ndifferent regions of one image more accurately and efficiently, given the same\ncomplexity. Besides, in the encoding/decoding network design part, we propose a\nconcatenated residual blocks (CRB), where multiple residual blocks are serially\nconnected with additional shortcut connections. The CRB can improve the\nlearning ability of the network, which can further improve the compression\nperformance. Experimental results using the Kodak, Tecnick-100 and Tecnick-40\ndatasets show that the proposed scheme outperforms all the leading\nlearning-based methods and existing compression standards including VVC intra\ncoding (4:4:4 and 4:2:0) in terms of the PSNR and MS-SSIM.

This approach substantially reduces\nbandwidth and memory demands during image capture and enables a range of\ndownstream tasks focused on the latent space. We validate this principle\nthrough an initial hardware prototype based on a single-pixel camera. By\nimplementing an amplitude modulation scheme that encodes into the generative\nmodel's latent space, we achieve compression ratios ranging from 1:100 to\n1:1000 during imaging, and up to 1:16384 for downstream applications.

Current surveys on\nimage-text multimodal models mainly focus on representative models or\napplication domains, but lack a review on how general technical models\ninfluence the development of domain-specific models, which is crucial for\ndomain researchers. Based on this, this paper first reviews the technological\nevolution of image-text multimodal models, from early explorations of feature\nspace to visual language encoding structures, and then to the latest large\nmodel architectures. Next, from the perspective of technological evolution, we\nexplain how the development of general image-text multimodal technologies\npromotes the progress of multimodal technologies in the biomedical field, as\nwell as the importance and complexity of specific datasets in the biomedical\ndomain. Then, centered on the tasks of image-text multimodal models, we analyze\ntheir common components and challenges. After that, we summarize the\narchitecture, components, and data of general image-text multimodal models, and\nintroduce the applications and improvements of image-text multimodal models in\nthe biomedical field. Finally, we categorize the challenges faced in the\ndevelopment and application of general models into external factors and\nintrinsic factors, further refining them into 2 external factors and 5\nintrinsic factors, and propose targeted solutions, providing guidance for\nfuture research directions.

            "abstract": "Recently deep learning-based image compression methods have achieved\nsignificant achievements and gradually outperformed traditional approaches\nincluding the latest standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) in both PSNR and\nMS-SSIM metrics. Two key components of learned image compression are the\nentropy model of the latent representations and the encoding/decoding network\narchitectures. Various models have been proposed, such as autoregressive,\nsoftmax, logistic mixture, Gaussian mixture, and Laplacian. Existing schemes\nonly use one of these models. However, due to the vast diversity of images, it\nis not optimal to use one model for all images, even different regions within\none image. In this paper, we propose a more flexible discretized\nGaussian-Laplacian-Logistic mixture model (GLLMM) for the latent\nrepresentations, which can adapt to different contents in different images and\ndifferent regions of one image more accurately and efficiently, given the same\ncomplexity. Besides, in the encoding/decoding network design part, we propose a\nconcatenated residual blocks (CRB), where multiple residual blocks are serially\nconnected with additional shortcut connections. The CRB can improve the\nlearning ability of the network, which can further improve the compression\nperformance. Experimental results using the Kodak, Tecnick-100 and Tecnick-40\ndatasets show that the proposed scheme outperforms all the leading\nlearning-based methods and existing compression standards including VVC intra\ncoding (4:4:4 and 4:2:0) in terms of the PSNR and MS-SSIM.

To address this limitation, we propose a\nprototype-driven curriculum leagrning framework that structures the learning\nprocess to progress from prototypical examples to more complex variations in\nthe dataset. Our approach introduces a temperature-based annealing scheme that\ngradually expands the training distribution, enabling more stable and efficient\nlearning trajectories. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, we\ndemonstrate that our curriculum learning strategy significantly improves both\ntraining efficiency and representation quality while requiring substantially\nfewer training epochs compared to standard Masked Auto-Encoding.

In contrast, clustering aims to group similar\nobjects together in an unsupervised manner. Usually, these two tasks are\nconsidered unrelated. However, the relationship between the two may be\nindirectly correlated, with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) acting as a bridge.\nIn this paper, we focus on exploring the correlation between distribution\nlearning and clustering, with the motivation to fill the gap between these two\nfields, utilizing an autoencoder (AE) to encode images into a high-dimensional\nlatent space. Then, Monte-Carlo Marginalization (MCMarg) and Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence loss are used to fit the Gaussian components of the GMM and\nlearn the data distribution. Finally, image clustering is achieved through each\nGaussian component of GMM. Yet, the \"curse of dimensionality\" poses severe\nchallenges for most clustering algorithms. Compared with the classic\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm, experimental results show that MCMarg\nand KL divergence can greatly alleviate the difficulty. Based on the\nexperimental results, we believe distribution learning can exploit the\npotential of GMM in image clustering within high-dimensional space.",

Most existing works explore the semantic encoding and transmission\nfor text and apply techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret\nthe meaning of the text. In this paper, we conceive the semantic communications\nfor image data that is much more richer in semantics and bandwidth sensitive.\nWe propose an reinforcement learning based adaptive semantic coding (RL-ASC)\napproach that encodes images beyond pixel level. Firstly, we define the\nsemantic concept of image data that includes the category, spatial arrangement,\nand visual feature as the representation unit, and propose a convolutional\nsemantic encoder to extract semantic concepts. Secondly, we propose the image\nreconstruction criterion that evolves from the traditional pixel similarity to\nsemantic similarity and perceptual performance. Thirdly, we design a novel\nRL-based semantic bit allocation model, whose reward is the increase in\nrate-semantic-perceptual performance after encoding a certain semantic concept\nwith adaptive quantization level. Thus, the task-related information is\npreserved and reconstructed properly while less important data is discarded.\nFinally, we propose the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based semantic\ndecoder that fuses both locally and globally features via an attention module.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-ASC is noise robust and\ncould reconstruct visually pleasant and semantic consistent image, and saves\ntimes of bit cost compared to standard codecs and other deep learning-based\nimage codecs.",

One such state-of-the-art method is\nknown as soft context formation (SCF). For each pixel to be encoded, a\nprobability distribution is estimated based on the neighboring pattern and the\noccurrence of that pattern in the already encoded image. Using an arithmetic\ncoder, the pixel color can thus be encoded very efficiently, provided that the\ncurrent color has been observed before in association with a similar pattern.\nIf this is not the case, the color is instead encoded using a color palette or,\nif it is still unknown, via residual coding. Both palette-based coding and\nresidual coding have significantly worse compression efficiency than coding\nbased on soft context formation. In this paper, the residual coding stage is\nimproved by adaptively trimming the probability distributions for the residual\nerror. Furthermore, an enhanced probability modeling for indicating a new color\ndepending on the occurrence of new colors in the neighborhood is proposed.\nThese modifications result in a bitrate reduction of up to 2.9% on average.\nCompared to HEVC (HM-16.21 + SCM-8.8) and FLIF, the improved SCF method saves\non average about 11% and 18% rate, respectively.",

Then, Monte-Carlo Marginalization (MCMarg) and Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence loss are used to fit the Gaussian components of the GMM and\nlearn the data distribution. Finally, image clustering is achieved through each\nGaussian component of GMM. Yet, the \"curse of dimensionality\" poses severe\nchallenges for most clustering algorithms.

Traditional image\ncompression techniques often sacrifice image fidelity for reduced file sizes,\nchallenging maintaining quality and efficiency.

The\npaper also introduces a composite loss function that combines reconstruction\nloss and residual loss for improved performance. The autoencoder architecture\nis designed to achieve optimal dimensionality reduction and regeneration\naccuracy while safeguarding the compressed data during transmission or storage.\nImages regenerated by the autoencoder are evaluated against three key metrics:\nreconstruction quality, compression ratio, and one-way delay during image\ntransfer. The experiments reveal that the proposed architecture achieves an\nSSIM of 97.5% over the regenerated images and an average latency reduction of\n87.5%, indicating its effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for\ncompressed image transfer.",

In this paper, we present MLICv2 and MLICv2$^+$, enhanced\nversions of the MLIC series, featuring improved transform techniques, entropy\nmodeling, and instance adaptability. For better transform, we introduce a\nsimple token mixing transform block inspired by the meta transformer\narchitecture, addressing the performance degradation at high bit-rates observed\nin previous MLIC series while maintaining computational efficiency. To enhance\nentropy modeling, we propose a hyperprior-guided global correlation prediction,\nenabling the capture of global contexts in the initial slice of the latent\nrepresentation. We also develop a channel reweighting module to dynamically\nprioritize important channels within each context. Additionally, advanced\npositional embedding for context modeling and selective compression with guided\noptimization are investigated. To boost instance adaptability, we employ\nstochastic Gumbel annealing to iteratively refine the latent representation\naccording to the rate-distortion optimization of a specific input image. This\napproach further enhances performance without impacting decoding speed.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our MLICv2 and MLICv2$^+$ achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, reducing Bjontegaard-Delta rate (BD-rate) by\n16.54%, 21.61%, 16.05% and 20.46%, 24.35%, 19.14% respectively, compared to\nVTM-17.0 Intra on the Kodak, Tecnick, CLIC Pro Val dataset, respectively.",

Here we present context-based convolutional networks\n(CCNs) for efficient and effective entropy modeling. In particular, a 3D zigzag\nscanning order and a 3D code dividing technique are introduced to define proper\ncoding contexts for parallel entropy decoding, both of which boil down to place\ntranslation-invariant binary masks on convolution filters of CCNs. We\ndemonstrate the promise of CCNs for entropy modeling in both lossless and lossy\nimage compression. For the former, we directly apply a CCN to the binarized\nrepresentation of an image to compute the Bernoulli distribution of each code\nfor entropy estimation. For the latter, the categorical distribution of each\ncode is represented by a discretized mixture of Gaussian distributions, whose\nparameters are estimated by three CCNs. We then jointly optimize the CCN-based\nentropy model along with analysis and synthesis transforms for rate-distortion\nperformance.

ICM is a vital research field that pursues the use\nof images for image recognition models, facilitating efficient image\ntransmission and storage. The demand for recognition models is growing rapidly\namong the general public, and their performance continues to improve. To meet\nthese needs, exchanging image data between consumer devices and cloud AI using\nICM technology could be one possible solution. In ICM, various image\ncompression methods have adopted Learned Image Compression (LIC). LIC includes\nan entropy model for estimating the bitrate of latent features, and the design\nof this model significantly affects its performance. Typically, LIC methods\nassume that the distribution of latent features follows a normal distribution.\nThis assumption is effective for compressing images intended for human vision.\nHowever, employing an entropy model based on normal distribution is inefficient\nin ICM due to the limitation of image parts that require precise decoding. To\naddress this, we propose Delta-ICM, which uses a probability distribution based\non a delta function. Assuming the delta distribution as a distribution of\nlatent features reduces the entropy of image portions unnecessary for machines.\nWe compress the remaining portions using an entropy model based on normal\ndistribution, similar to existing methods. Delta-ICM selects between the\nentropy model based on the delta distribution and the one based on the normal\ndistribution for each latent feature.

            "abstract": "Personalization in Information Retrieval (IR) is a topic studied by the\nresearch community since a long time. However, there is still a lack of\ndatasets to conduct large-scale evaluations of personalized IR; this is mainly\ndue to the fact that collecting and curating high-quality user-related\ninformation requires significant costs and time investment. Furthermore, the\ncreation of datasets for Personalized IR (PIR) tasks is affected by both\nprivacy concerns and the need for accurate user-related data, which are often\nnot publicly available. Recently, researchers have started to explore the use\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets, which is a\npossible solution to generate data for low-resource tasks. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating\nsynthetic documents to train an IR system for a Personalized Community Question\nAnswering task. To study the effectiveness of IR models fine-tuned on\nLLM-generated data, we introduce a new dataset, named Sy-SE-PQA. We build\nSy-SE-PQA based on an existing dataset, SE-PQA, which consists of questions and\nanswers posted on the popular StackExchange communities. Starting from\nquestions in SE-PQA, we generate synthetic answers using different prompt\ntechniques and LLMs. Our findings suggest that LLMs have high potential in\ngenerating data tailored to users' needs. The synthetic data can replace\nhuman-written training data, even if the generated data may contain incorrect\ninformation.",

However, we argue\nthat language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most\nword tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for\nreasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge\nchallenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an\nunrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new\nparadigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden\nstate of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed \"continuous\nthought\"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the\nLLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.\nExperiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several\nreasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent\nadvanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple\nalternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a\nsingle deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical\nreasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with\nfewer thinking tokens during inference.

The potential of\nLLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring\nautomated hardware generation and automation. Although preliminary endeavors\nhave been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages\n(HDLs), several challenges persist in this direction. First, the volume of\navailable HDL training data is substantially smaller compared to that for\nsoftware programming languages. Second, the pre-trained LLMs, mainly tailored\nfor software code, tend to produce HDL designs that are more error-prone.\nThird, the generation of HDL requires a significantly higher number of tokens\ncompared to software programming, leading to inefficiencies in cost and energy\nconsumption. To tackle these challenges, this paper explores leveraging LLMs to\ngenerate High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design. Although code\ngeneration for domain-specific programming languages is not new in the\nliterature, we aim to provide experimental results, insights, benchmarks, and\nevaluation infrastructure to investigate the suitability of HLS over low-level\nHDLs for LLM-assisted hardware design generation. To achieve this, we first\nfinetune pre-trained models for HLS-based hardware generation, using a\ncollected dataset with text prompts and corresponding reference HLS designs. An\nLLM-assisted framework is then proposed to automate end-to-end hardware code\ngeneration, which also investigates the impact of chain-of-thought and feedback\nloops promoting techniques on HLS-design generation. Limited by the timeframe\nof this research, we plan to evaluate more advanced reasoning models in the\nfuture.",

Given the great success in natural language\ngeneration and programming language comprehension, large language models (LLMs)\nmight help developers generate logging statements, but this has not yet been\ninvestigated. To fill the gap, this paper performs the first study on exploring\nLLMs for logging statement generation.We first build a logging statement\ngeneration dataset, LogBench, with two parts: (1) LogBench-O: logging\nstatements collected from GitHub repositories, and (2) LogBench-T: the\ntransformed unseen code from LogBench-O. Then, we leverage LogBench to evaluate\nthe effectiveness and generalization capabilities (using LogBench-T) of eleven\ntop-performing LLMs. In addition, we examine the performance of these LLMs\nagainst classical retrieval-based and machine learning-based logging methods\nfrom the era preceding LLMs. We further evaluate LLM's logging generalization\ncapabilities using unseen data (LogBench-T) derived from code transformation\ntechniques. While existing LLMs deliver decent predictions on logging levels\nand logging variables, our study indicates that they only achieve a maximum\nBLEU score of 0.249, thus calling for improvements. The paper also highlights\nthe importance of prompt constructions and external factors (e.g., programming\ncontexts and code comments) for LLMs' logging performance. Based on these\nfindings, we identify five implications and provide practical advice for future\nlogging research.

Given this\nvariety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are\nscarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what\nbottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of\nsynthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity,\nand complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in\nopen-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream\nmodels. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model\ngeneralization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize\nthe existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the\ndownstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various\ncomponents in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This\nexamination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation\nalgorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on\ndata QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance\nof balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and\nself-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data,\noften there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity\nwhich impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are\ncurrently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting\noutput diversity and the potential for self-improvement. We argue that\nbalancing these trade-offs is essential to the development of future\nself-improvement algorithms and highlight a number of works making progress in\nthis direction.",

In this\nwork, we systematically investigate the scaling laws of synthetic data by\nintroducing SynthLLM, a scalable framework that transforms pre-training corpora\ninto diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets. Our approach achieves this by\nautomatically extracting and recombining high-level concepts across multiple\ndocuments using a graph algorithm. Key findings from our extensive mathematical\nexperiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that\nreliably adheres to the rectified scaling law across various model sizes; (2)\nPerformance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models\napproach optimal performance with fewer training tokens. For instance, an 8B\nmodel peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T.

Providing these steps for prompting\ndemonstrations is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT prompting has\ntwo major paradigms. One leverages a simple prompt like \"Let's think step by\nstep\" to facilitate step-by-step thinking before answering a question. The\nother uses a few manual demonstrations one by one, each composed of a question\nand a reasoning chain that leads to an answer. The superior performance of the\nsecond paradigm hinges on the hand-crafting of task-specific demonstrations one\nby one. We show that such manual efforts may be eliminated by leveraging LLMs\nwith the \"Let's think step by step\" prompt to generate reasoning chains for\ndemonstrations one by one, i.e., let's think not just step by step, but also\none by one. However, these generated chains often come with mistakes. To\nmitigate the effect of such mistakes, we find that diversity matters for\nautomatically constructing demonstrations. We propose an automatic CoT\nprompting method: Auto-CoT. It samples questions with diversity and generates\nreasoning chains to construct demonstrations. On ten public benchmark reasoning\ntasks with GPT-3, Auto-CoT consistently matches or exceeds the performance of\nthe CoT paradigm that requires manual designs of demonstrations.

However, we argue\nthat language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most\nword tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for\nreasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge\nchallenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an\nunrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new\nparadigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden\nstate of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed \"continuous\nthought\"). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the\nLLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space.\nExperiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several\nreasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent\nadvanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple\nalternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first\nsearch (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a\nsingle deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical\nreasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with\nfewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise\nof latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.",

Through 29 interviews with AI practitioners and responsible\nAI experts, we examine the expanding role of synthetic data in AI development.\nOur findings reveal how auxiliary models are now widely used across the AI\ndevelopment pipeline. Practitioners describe synthetic data as crucial for\naddressing data scarcity and providing a competitive edge, noting that\nevaluation of generative AI systems at scale would be infeasible without\nauxiliary models. However, they face challenges controlling the outputs of\nauxiliary models, generating data that accurately depict underrepresented\ngroups, and scaling data validation practices that are based primarily on\nmanual inspection. We detail general limitations of and ethical considerations\nfor synthetic data and conclude with a proposal of concrete steps towards the\ndevelopment of best practices for its responsible use.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image synthesis\nand related generative tasks. Nevertheless, their practicality for real-world\napplications is constrained by substantial computational costs and latency\nissues. Quantization is a dominant way to compress and accelerate diffusion\nmodels, where post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training\n(QAT) are two main approaches, each bearing its own properties. While PTQ\nexhibits efficiency in terms of both time and data usage, it may lead to\ndiminished performance in low bit-width. On the other hand, QAT can alleviate\nperformance degradation but comes with substantial demands on computational and\ndata resources. In this paper, we introduce a data-free and parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning framework for low-bit diffusion models, dubbed EfficientDM, to\nachieve QAT-level performance with PTQ-like efficiency. Specifically, we\npropose a quantization-aware variant of the low-rank adapter (QALoRA) that can\nbe merged with model weights and jointly quantized to low bit-width. The\nfine-tuning process distills the denoising capabilities of the full-precision\nmodel into its quantized counterpart, eliminating the requirement for training\ndata. We also introduce scale-aware optimization and temporal learned step-size\nquantization to further enhance performance. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous PTQ-based\ndiffusion models while maintaining similar time and data efficiency.\nSpecifically, there is only a 0.05 sFID increase when quantizing both weights\nand activations of LDM-4 to 4-bit on ImageNet 256x256. Compared to QAT-based\nmethods, our EfficientDM also boasts a 16.2x faster quantization speed with\ncomparable generation quality.

To address the heavy computation and parameter\ndrawbacks, quantization is frequently studied in the community as a\nrepresentative model compression technique and has seen extensive use on\nConvNets. However, due to the unique properties of transformers, the low-bit\nquantization applications are still limited and underexplored. In this paper,\nwe identify the difficulty of transformer low-bit quantization-aware training\non its unique variation behaviors, which significantly differ from ConvNets.\nBased on comprehensive quantitative analysis, we observe variation in three\nhierarchies: various module quantization sensitivities, outliers in static\nweight and activation distribution, and oscillation in dynamic parameter\nfluctuations. These variations of transformers bring instability to the\nquantization-aware training (QAT) and negatively influence the performance. We\nexplore the best practices to alleviate the variation's influence during\nlow-bit transformer QAT and propose a variation-aware quantization scheme for\nboth vision and language transformers. We extensively verify and show our\nscheme can alleviate the variation and improve the performance of transformers\nacross various models and tasks.

Post-training quantization reduces model size\nefficiently at the cost of decreased accuracy, while quantization-aware\ntraining better preserves accuracy but is resource-intensive. Among existing\npost-training quantization algorithms, the ApiQ method achieves superior\naccuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two\nideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level.\nFirst, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques\nwith ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the\nbaseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads\nto two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is\ngained through full retraining may not be feasible through partial training.\n(2) This gain seems to depend on using a large and diverse dataset in\nquantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the\ntwo insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon\nApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. It\nrelies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the\nmost impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on benchmark\nlanguage models from the LLaMA family show that our proposed approach boosts\naccuracy and tightens the gap between the quantized model and the\nfull-precision model, with minimal overhead. Our method will be made publicly\navailable to facilitate future developments in ultra-low-bit quantization of\nlarge language models.",

In particular, LLaMA3 models have recently been released\nand have achieved impressive performance in various domains with super-large\nscale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of\nlow-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios, we explore\nLLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration can\npotentially provide new insights and challenges for the low-bit quantization of\nLLaMA3 and other future LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation\nissues that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we comprehensively\nevaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA fine-tuning\n(LoRA-FT) methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and various datasets to reveal the\nlow-bit quantization performance of LLaMA3. To uncover the capabilities of\nlow-bit quantized MLLM, we assessed the performance of the LLaMA3-based\nLLaVA-Next-8B model under 2-4 ultra-low bits with post-training quantization\nmethods. Our experimental results indicate that LLaMA3 still suffers from\nnon-negligible degradation in linguistic and visual contexts, particularly\nunder ultra-low bit widths.

Nevertheless, their practicality for real-world\napplications is constrained by substantial computational costs and latency\nissues. Quantization is a dominant way to compress and accelerate diffusion\nmodels, where post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training\n(QAT) are two main approaches, each bearing its own properties. While PTQ\nexhibits efficiency in terms of both time and data usage, it may lead to\ndiminished performance in low bit-width. On the other hand, QAT can alleviate\nperformance degradation but comes with substantial demands on computational and\ndata resources. In this paper, we introduce a data-free and parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning framework for low-bit diffusion models, dubbed EfficientDM, to\nachieve QAT-level performance with PTQ-like efficiency. Specifically, we\npropose a quantization-aware variant of the low-rank adapter (QALoRA) that can\nbe merged with model weights and jointly quantized to low bit-width. The\nfine-tuning process distills the denoising capabilities of the full-precision\nmodel into its quantized counterpart, eliminating the requirement for training\ndata. We also introduce scale-aware optimization and temporal learned step-size\nquantization to further enhance performance. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous PTQ-based\ndiffusion models while maintaining similar time and data efficiency.\nSpecifically, there is only a 0.05 sFID increase when quantizing both weights\nand activations of LDM-4 to 4-bit on ImageNet 256x256.

Specifically, we\npropose a quantization-aware variant of the low-rank adapter (QALoRA) that can\nbe merged with model weights and jointly quantized to low bit-width. The\nfine-tuning process distills the denoising capabilities of the full-precision\nmodel into its quantized counterpart, eliminating the requirement for training\ndata.

We claim that coupling a\nuser-defined learning rate (LR) with these optimizers is sub-optimal for QAT.\nQuantized weights transit discrete levels of a quantizer, only if corresponding\nlatent weights pass transition points, where the quantizer changes discrete\nstates. This suggests that the changes of quantized weights are affected by\nboth the LR for latent weights and their distributions. It is thus difficult to\ncontrol the degree of changes for quantized weights by scheduling the LR\nmanually.

Based on this,\nwe introduce a transition rate (TR) scheduling technique that controls the\nnumber of transitions of quantized weights explicitly. Instead of scheduling a\nLR for latent weights, we schedule a target TR of quantized weights, and update\nthe latent weights with a novel transition-adaptive LR (TALR), enabling\nconsidering the degree of changes for the quantized weights during QAT.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on standard\nbenchmarks.",

The low-precision model exhibits limited\nrepresentation capabilities and cannot directly replicate full-precision\ncalculations, which constitutes a deficiency compared to full-precision\nalternatives; 2. Non-ideal deviations during gradient propagation are a common\nconsequence of employing pseudo-gradients as approximations in derived\nquantized functions. In this paper, we propose a general QAT framework for\nalleviating the aforementioned concerns by permitting the forward and backward\nprocesses of the low-precision network to be guided by the full-precision\npartner during training. In conjunction with the direct training of the\nquantization model, intermediate mixed-precision models are generated through\nthe block-by-block replacement on the full-precision model and working\nsimultaneously with the low-precision backbone, which enables the integration\nof quantized low-precision blocks into full-precision networks throughout the\ntraining phase. Consequently, each quantized block is capable of: 1. simulating\nfull-precision representation during forward passes; 2. obtaining gradients\nwith improved estimation during backward passes. We demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art results for 4-, 3-, and 2-bit\nquantization on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. The proposed framework provides a\ncompatible extension for most QAT methods and only requires a concise wrapper\nfor existing codes.",

Quantization methods compress\ntheir size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized\nvalues of lower precision. Post-training quantization reduces model size\nefficiently at the cost of decreased accuracy, while quantization-aware\ntraining better preserves accuracy but is resource-intensive. Among existing\npost-training quantization algorithms, the ApiQ method achieves superior\naccuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two\nideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level.\nFirst, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques\nwith ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the\nbaseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads\nto two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is\ngained through full retraining may not be feasible through partial training.\n(2) This gain seems to depend on using a large and diverse dataset in\nquantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the\ntwo insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon\nApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. It\nrelies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the\nmost impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on benchmark\nlanguage models from the LLaMA family show that our proposed approach boosts\naccuracy and tightens the gap between the quantized model and the\nfull-precision model, with minimal overhead. Our method will be made publicly\navailable to facilitate future developments in ultra-low-bit quantization of\nlarge language models.",

Nevertheless, their practicality for real-world\napplications is constrained by substantial computational costs and latency\nissues. Quantization is a dominant way to compress and accelerate diffusion\nmodels, where post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training\n(QAT) are two main approaches, each bearing its own properties. While PTQ\nexhibits efficiency in terms of both time and data usage, it may lead to\ndiminished performance in low bit-width. On the other hand, QAT can alleviate\nperformance degradation but comes with substantial demands on computational and\ndata resources. In this paper, we introduce a data-free and parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning framework for low-bit diffusion models, dubbed EfficientDM, to\nachieve QAT-level performance with PTQ-like efficiency. Specifically, we\npropose a quantization-aware variant of the low-rank adapter (QALoRA) that can\nbe merged with model weights and jointly quantized to low bit-width. The\nfine-tuning process distills the denoising capabilities of the full-precision\nmodel into its quantized counterpart, eliminating the requirement for training\ndata. We also introduce scale-aware optimization and temporal learned step-size\nquantization to further enhance performance. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous PTQ-based\ndiffusion models while maintaining similar time and data efficiency.\nSpecifically, there is only a 0.05 sFID increase when quantizing both weights\nand activations of LDM-4 to 4-bit on ImageNet 256x256. Compared to QAT-based\nmethods, our EfficientDM also boasts a 16.2x faster quantization speed with\ncomparable generation quality.

While\nthese paths may resemble the native reasoning paths of RL models, they often\ninvolve prolonged, hesitant, less informative steps, and incorrect reasoning.\nTo systematically study this effect, we introduce VLAA-Thinking, a new\nmultimodal dataset designed to support reasoning in LVLMs. Constructed via a\nsix-step pipeline involving captioning, reasoning distillation, answer rewrite\nand verification, VLAA-Thinking comprises high-quality, step-by-step visual\nreasoning traces for SFT, along with a more challenging RL split from the same\ndata source. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive experiments comparing\nSFT, RL and their combinations. Results show that while SFT helps models learn\nreasoning formats, it often locks aligned models into imitative, rigid\nreasoning modes that impede further learning. In contrast, building on the\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel mixed reward module\nintegrating both perception and cognition signals, our RL approach fosters more\ngenuine, adaptive reasoning behavior.

Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to\nunlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios.\nSeveral alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or\nhybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear,\nespecially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily\nverified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation\nstrategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation,\nQuestion Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs\ntrained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query\nbudget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across\nsettings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the\nratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed\ninstruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing\nquestions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new\nquestions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of\naugmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low\nto mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework\nfor selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into\naccount additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the\nimportance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for\nsynthetic data generation.",

While previous\nliterature has focused predominantly on the quality and quantity of real data,\nour work enables the measurement of diversity in synthetic data and explores\nits impact on LLM performance. We study the downstream effects of synthetic\ndata diversity during both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages by\nintroducing a new diversity metric, \\textit{LLM cluster-agent}, designed to\nevaluate the diversity of synthetic datasets. Through a series of controlled\nexperiments with models of 350M and 1.4B parameters, we demonstrate that the\nproposed cluster-based LLM scoring of diversity correlates positively with both\npre-training and supervised fine-tuning performance. Our findings also reveal\nthat synthetic data diversity in pre-training affects supervised fine-tuning\nmore significantly than pre-training itself, even for smaller models.

However, traditional approaches like RLHF or RLAIF treat the\nproblem as single-step. As focus shifts toward more complex reasoning and\nagentic tasks, language models must take multiple steps of text generation,\nreasoning and environment interaction before generating a solution. We propose\na synthetic data generation and RL methodology targeting multi-step\noptimization scenarios. This approach, called Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning\n(SWiRL), iteratively generates multi-step reasoning and tool use data, and then\nlearns from that data. It employs a simple step-wise decomposition that breaks\neach multi-step trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories corresponding to each\naction by the original model. It then applies synthetic data filtering and RL\noptimization on these sub-trajectories. We evaluated SWiRL on a number of\nmulti-step tool use, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Our\nexperiments show that SWiRL outperforms baseline approaches by 21.5%, 12.3%,\n14.8%, 11.1%, and 15.3% in relative accuracy on GSM8K, HotPotQA, CofCA,\nMuSiQue, and BeerQA, respectively.

This could circumvent the necessity of collecting labeled real-world\ndata, thereby presenting a form of data-free knowledge distillation. However,\nthe resultant student models show a significant drop in accuracy compared to\nmodels trained on real data. We investigate possible causes for this drop and\nfocus on the role of the different layers of the student model. By training\nthese layers using either real or synthetic data, we reveal that the drop\nmainly stems from the model's final layers. Further, we briefly investigate\nother factors, such as differences in data-normalization between synthetic and\nreal, the impact of data augmentations, texture vs.\\ shape learning, and\nassuming oracle prompts. While we find that some of those factors can have an\nimpact, they are not sufficient to close the gap towards real data. Building\nupon our insights that mainly later layers are responsible for the drop, we\ninvestigate the data-efficiency of fine-tuning a synthetically trained model\nwith real data applied to only those last layers. Our results suggest an\nimproved trade-off between the amount of real training data used and the\nmodel's accuracy. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the gap\nbetween synthetic and real data and indicate solutions to mitigate the scarcity\nof labeled real data.",

However, the model size and performance of these long context\nmodels are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and\ninference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long\ninputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented\nGeneration (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the\ninput, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.\nThe core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,\nwhich does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest\nscores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this\nfrustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page\ndocuments using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,\nLLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG\nconsistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,\nFRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on\nVideo-MME. For documents, FRAG achieves over 20% improvements on MP-DocVQA\ncompared with recent LMMs specialized in long document understanding. Code is\navailable at: https://github.com/NVlabs/FRAG",

However, the model size and performance of these long context\nmodels are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and\ninference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long\ninputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented\nGeneration (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the\ninput, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames.\nThe core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently,\nwhich does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest\nscores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this\nfrustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page\ndocuments using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models,\nLLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG\nconsistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos,\nFRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on\nVideo-MME.

In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for\nhigh-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and\ncompressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures\ndynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video\nunderstanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving\nvideo LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both\ngeneral and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and\nTemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks,\nincluding high-speed sports analysis (\\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football,\ngymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like\nGPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro.

To compensate for the information loss caused by\ndeteriorated frames, recent approaches exploit transformer-based integration\nmodules to obtain spatio-temporal information. However, these integration\nmodules are heavy and complex. Furthermore, each integration module is\nspecifically tailored for its target task, making it difficult to generalise to\nmultiple tasks. In this paper, we present a neat and unified framework, called\nSpatio-Temporal Prompting Network (STPN). It can efficiently extract robust and\naccurate video features by dynamically adjusting the input features in the\nbackbone network. Specifically, STPN predicts several video prompts containing\nspatio-temporal information of neighbour frames. Then, these video prompts are\nprepended to the patch embeddings of the current frame as the updated input for\nvideo feature extraction. Moreover, STPN is easy to generalise to various video\ntasks because it does not contain task-specific modules. Without bells and\nwhistles, STPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used\ndatasets for different video understanding tasks, i.e., ImageNetVID for video\nobject detection, YouTubeVIS for video instance segmentation, and GOT-10k for\nvisual object tracking.

In\nterms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\\% of the\ncomputational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for\nreal-time video XAI analysis applications.

In practice, computational constraints necessitate coarse\nframe subsampling, a challenge analogous to ``finding a needle in a haystack.''\nTo address this issue, we introduce a semantics-driven search framework that\nreformulates keyframe selection under the paradigm of Visual Semantic-Logical\nSearch. Specifically, we systematically define four fundamental logical\ndependencies: 1) spatial co-occurrence, 2) temporal proximity, 3) attribute\ndependency, and 4) causal order. These relations dynamically update frame\nsampling distributions through an iterative refinement process, enabling\ncontext-aware identification of semantically critical frames tailored to\nspecific query requirements. Our method establishes new SOTA performance on the\nmanually annotated benchmark in key-frame selection metrics. Furthermore, when\napplied to downstream video question-answering tasks, the proposed approach\ndemonstrates the best performance gains over existing methods on LongVideoBench\nand Video-MME, validating its effectiveness in bridging the logical gap between\ntextual queries and visual-temporal reasoning. The code will be publicly\navailable.",

Frame selection aims to extract the most informative\nand representative frames to help a model better understand video content.\nExisting frame selection methods either individually sample frames based on\nper-frame importance prediction, without considering interaction among frames,\nor adopt reinforcement learning agents to find representative frames in\nsuccession, which are costly to train and may lead to potential stability\nissues. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a\nSearch-Map-Search learning paradigm which combines the advantages of heuristic\nsearch and supervised learning to select the best combination of frames from a\nvideo as one entity. By combining search with learning, the proposed method can\nbetter capture frame interactions while incurring a low inference overhead.\nSpecifically, we first propose a hierarchical search method conducted on each\ntraining video to search for the optimal combination of frames with the lowest\nerror on the downstream task. A feature mapping function is then learned to map\nthe frames of a video to the representation of its target optimal frame\ncombination. During inference, another search is performed on an unseen video\nto select a combination of frames whose feature representation is close to the\nprojected feature representation. Extensive experiments based on several action\nrecognition benchmarks demonstrate that our frame selection method effectively\nimproves performance of action recognition models, and significantly\noutperforms a number of competitive baselines.",

Experiments on RAbD benchmark show that our approach\neffectively optimizes the energy of generated antibodies and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in designing high-quality antibodies with low\ntotal energy and high binding affinity simultaneously, demonstrating the\nsuperiority of our approach.",

Prior approaches have resorted\nto evolutionary strategies or Monte-Carlo methods for protein design, but often\nfail to exploit the structure of the combinatorial search space, to generalize\nto unseen sequences. In the context of discrete black box optimization over\nlarge search spaces, learning a mutation policy to generate novel sequences\nwith reinforcement learning is appealing. Recent advances in protein language\nmodels (PLMs) trained on large corpora of protein sequences offer a potential\nsolution to this problem by scoring proteins according to their biological\nplausibility (such as the TM-score). In this work, we propose to use PLMs as a\nreward function to generate new sequences. Yet the PLM can be computationally\nexpensive to query due to its large size. To this end, we propose an\nalternative paradigm where optimization can be performed on scores from a\nsmaller proxy model that is periodically finetuned, jointly while learning the\nmutation policy. We perform extensive experiments on various sequence lengths\nto benchmark RL-based approaches, and provide comprehensive evaluations along\nbiological plausibility and diversity of the protein. Our experimental results\ninclude favorable evaluations of the proposed sequences, along with high\ndiversity scores, demonstrating that RL is a strong candidate for biological\nsequence design. Finally, we provide a modular open source implementation can\nbe easily integrated in most RL training loops, with support for replacing the\nreward model with other PLMs, to spur further research in this domain. The code\nfor all experiments is provided in the supplementary material.",

To address these challenges, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) methods, such as GFlowNets, utilize proxy models for rapid reward\nevaluation and annotated data for policy training. Although these approaches\nhave shown promise in generating diverse and novel sequences, the limited\ntraining data relative to the vast search space often leads to the\nmisspecification of proxy for out-of-distribution inputs. We introduce\n$\\delta$-Conservative Search, a novel off-policy search method for training\nGFlowNets designed to improve robustness against proxy misspecification. The\nkey idea is to incorporate conservativeness, controlled by parameter $\\delta$,\nto constrain the search to reliable regions. Specifically, we inject noise into\nhigh-score offline sequences by randomly masking tokens with a Bernoulli\ndistribution of parameter $\\delta$ and then denoise masked tokens using the\nGFlowNet policy. Additionally, $\\delta$ is adaptively adjusted based on the\nuncertainty of the proxy model for each data point. This enables the reflection\nof proxy uncertainty to determine the level of conservativeness. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing machine\nlearning methods in discovering high-score sequences across diverse\ntasks-including DNA, RNA, protein, and peptide design-especially in large-scale\nscenarios.",

As a result, various solutions have been proposed in which the\nmachine learning models run on a remote cloud provider and not locally on a\nuser's machine. However, when such a model is deployed on an untrusted cloud\nprovider, it is of vital importance that the users' privacy is preserved. To\nthis end, we propose Learning in the Dark -- a hybrid machine learning model in\nwhich the training phase occurs in plaintext data, but the classification of\nthe users' inputs is performed directly on homomorphically encrypted\nciphertexts. To make our construction compatible with homomorphic encryption,\nwe approximate the ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions using low-degree\nChebyshev polynomials. This allowed us to build Learning in the Dark -- a\nprivacy-preserving machine learning model that can classify encrypted images\nwith high accuracy. Learning in the Dark preserves users' privacy since it is\ncapable of performing high accuracy predictions by performing computations\ndirectly on encrypted data. In addition to that, the output of Learning in the\nDark is generated in a blind and therefore privacy-preserving way by utilizing\nthe properties of homomorphic encryption.",

In this paradigm, only model updates, such as model weights\nor gradients, are shared. Many existing approaches have focused on horizontal\nFL, where each party has the entire feature set and labels in the training data\nset. However, many real scenarios follow a vertically-partitioned FL setup,\nwhere a complete feature set is formed only when all the datasets from the\nparties are combined, and the labels are only available to a single party.\nPrivacy-preserving vertical FL is challenging because complete sets of labels\nand features are not owned by one entity. Existing approaches for vertical FL\nrequire multiple peer-to-peer communications among parties, leading to lengthy\ntraining times, and are restricted to (approximated) linear models and just two\nparties. To close this gap, we propose FedV, a framework for secure gradient\ncomputation in vertical settings for several widely used ML models such as\nlinear models, logistic regression, and support vector machines. FedV removes\nthe need for peer-to-peer communication among parties by using functional\nencryption schemes; this allows FedV to achieve faster training times. It also\nworks for larger and changing sets of parties.

Within the scope of privacy preservation, information privacy\nregulations such as GDPR entitle users to request the removal (or unlearning)\nof their contribution from a service that is hosting the model. For this\npurpose, a server hosting an ML model must be able to unlearn certain\ninformation in cases such as copyright infringement or security issues that can\nmake the model vulnerable or impact the performance of a service based on that\nmodel. While most unlearning approaches in FL focus on Horizontal FL (HFL),\nwhere clients share the feature space and the global model, Vertical FL (VFL)\nhas received less attention from the research community. VFL involves clients\n(passive parties) sharing the sample space among them while not having access\nto the labels. In this paper, we explore unlearning in VFL from three\nperspectives: unlearning clients, unlearning features, and unlearning samples.\nTo unlearn clients and features we introduce VFU-KD which is based on knowledge\ndistillation (KD) while to unlearn samples, VFU-GA is introduced which is based\non gradient ascent. To provide evidence of approximate unlearning, we utilize\nMembership Inference Attack (MIA) to audit the effectiveness of our unlearning\napproach. Our experiments across six tabular datasets and two image datasets\ndemonstrate that VFU-KD and VFU-GA achieve performance comparable to or better\nthan both retraining from scratch and the benchmark R2S method in many cases,\nwith improvements of $(0-2\\%)$. In the remaining cases, utility scores remain\ncomparable, with a modest utility loss ranging from $1-5\\%$. Unlike existing\nmethods, VFU-KD and VFU-GA require no communication between active and passive\nparties during unlearning.

However, privacy concerns surrounding patient\ndata hinder the assembly of large training datasets needed for developing and\ntraining accurate, robust, and generalizable models.

Sensitive\ninformation can still be gleaned from shared gradients that are passed on\nbetween organizations during model training. Additionally, in medical imaging,\nquantifying model confidence\\uncertainty accurately is crucial due to the noise\nand artifacts present in the data. Uncertainty estimation in FL encounters\nunique hurdles due to data heterogeneity across organizations.

Traditional methods, where everything was\nstored in one place, had big problems with keeping information private,\nhandling large amounts of data, and avoiding unfair advantages. Machine\nLearning has become a powerful tool that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to\novercome these challenges. We started by learning the basics of Machine\nLearning, including the different types like supervised, unsupervised, and\nreinforcement learning. We also explored the important steps involved, such as\npreparing the data, choosing the right model, training it, and then checking\nits performance. Next, we examined some key challenges in Machine Learning,\nsuch as models learning too much from specific examples (overfitting), not\nlearning enough (underfitting), and reflecting biases in the data used. Moving\nbeyond centralized systems, we looked at decentralized Machine Learning and its\nbenefits, like keeping data private, getting answers faster, and using a wider\nvariety of data sources. We then focused on a specific type called federated\nlearning, where models are trained without directly sharing sensitive\ninformation. Real-world examples from healthcare and finance were used to show\nhow collaborative Machine Learning can solve important problems while still\nprotecting information security. Finally, we discussed challenges like\ncommunication efficiency, dealing with different types of data, and security.\nWe also explored using a Zero Trust framework, which provides an extra layer of\nprotection for collaborative Machine Learning systems.

This survey\nstarts with a high-level overview of the technical workings of ZKPs with a\nfocus on an increasingly relevant subset of ZKPs called zk-SNARKS. While there\nhave been prior surveys on the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of ZKPs, our\nwork is distinguished by providing a broader view of practical aspects and\ndescribing many recently-developed use cases of ZKPs across various domains.\nThese application domains span blockchain privacy, scaling, storage, and\ninteroperability, as well as non-blockchain applications like voting,\nauthentication, timelocks, and machine learning. Aimed at both practitioners\nand researchers, the survey also covers foundational components and\ninfrastructure such as zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVM), domain-specific\nlanguages (DSLs), supporting libraries, frameworks, and protocols.

Recent studies have explored and exploited\nlarge-scale text-to-image diffusion models for text-guided video editing,\nresulting in remarkable video editing capabilities. However, they may still\nsuffer from some limitations such as mislocated objects, incorrect number of\nobjects. Therefore, the controllability of video editing remains a formidable\nchallenge. In this paper, we aim to challenge the above limitations by\nproposing a Re-Attentional Controllable Video Diffusion Editing (ReAtCo)\nmethod. Specially, to align the spatial placement of the target objects with\nthe edited text prompt in a training-free manner, we propose a Re-Attentional\nDiffusion (RAD) to refocus the cross-attention activation responses between the\nedited text prompt and the target video during the denoising stage, resulting\nin a spatially location-aligned and semantically high-fidelity manipulated\nvideo. In particular, to faithfully preserve the invariant region content with\nless border artifacts, we propose an Invariant Region-guided Joint Sampling\n(IRJS) strategy to mitigate the intrinsic sampling errors w.r.t the invariant\nregions at each denoising timestep and constrain the generated content to be\nharmonized with the invariant region content. Experimental results verify that\nReAtCo consistently improves the controllability of video diffusion editing and\nachieves superior video editing performance.",

Among various methods, recent\nworks have found that simply manipulating attention modules by concatenating\nfeatures from multiple reference images provides an efficient approach to\nenhancing consistency without fine-tuning. Despite its popularity and success,\nfew studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its\neffectiveness. In this work, we reveal that the popular approach is a linear\ninterpolation of image self-attention and cross-attention between synthesized\ncontent and reference features, with a constant rank-1 coefficient.

The resulting algorithm,\nwhich we coin as RefDrop, allows users to control the influence of reference\ncontext in a direct and precise manner. Besides further enhancing consistency\nin single-subject image generation, our method also enables more interesting\napplications, such as the consistent generation of multiple subjects,\nsuppressing specific features to encourage more diverse content, and\nhigh-quality personalized video generation by boosting temporal consistency.\nEven compared with state-of-the-art image-prompt-based generators, such as\nIP-Adapter, RefDrop is competitive in terms of controllability and quality\nwhile avoiding the need to train a separate image encoder for feature injection\nfrom reference images, making it a versatile plug-and-play solution for any\nimage or video diffusion model.",

In this paper, we propose Controllable Video\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts,\nthus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts.\nSpecifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle\nstatic and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change\nproperty to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables,\nenabling independent control over motion and identity. To establish the\ntheoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the\nidentifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we\ndesign a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce\nthe minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the\ndimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional\nindependence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in\nfor GANs.

Humans can perform a\nwide variety of actions and interactions, but existing datasets, like TikTok\nand TED-Talks, lack the diversity and complexity to fully capture the\ncapabilities of video generation models. We close this gap by introducing `What\nAre You Doing?' (WYD): a new benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of\ncontrollable image-to-video generation of humans. WYD consists of 1{,}544\ncaptioned videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 56\nfine-grained categories. These allow us to systematically measure performance\nacross 9 aspects of human generation, including actions, interactions and\nmotion. We also propose and validate automatic metrics that leverage our\nannotations and better capture human evaluations. Equipped with our dataset and\nmetrics, we perform in-depth analyses of seven state-of-the-art models in\ncontrollable image-to-video generation, showing how WYD provides novel insights\nabout the capabilities of these models.

Specifically, FACTOR aims to control objects' appearances and context,\nincluding their location and category, in conjunction with the text prompt. To\nachieve detailed control, we propose a unified framework to jointly inject\ncontrol signals into the existing text-to-video model. Our model consists of a\njoint encoder and adaptive cross-attention layers. By optimizing the encoder\nand the inserted layer, we adapt the model to generate videos that are aligned\nwith both text prompts and fine-grained control. Compared to existing methods\nrelying on dense control signals such as edge maps, we provide a more intuitive\nand user-friendly interface to allow object-level fine-grained control. Our\nmethod achieves controllability of object appearances without finetuning, which\nreduces the per-subject optimization efforts for the users.

Upon this, trajectory-controllable video\ngeneration has emerged to enable precise object motion control through\nexplicitly defined spatial paths.

Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single\nformat, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there\nis no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for\ntrajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and\nsystematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a\nnovel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control\nthrough three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes,\nand sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly\nanimates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object\nconsistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a\nlarge-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated\npipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control\naccuracy across different numbers of objects.

For real\nrobots, it is challenging to collect enough qualified data either as\ndemonstrations for IL or experiences for RL due to safety considerations in\nenvironments with obstacles. We target this challenge by proposing the\nself-imitation learning by planning plus (SILP+) algorithm, which efficiently\nembeds experience-based planning into the learning architecture to mitigate the\ndata-collection problem. The planner generates demonstrations based on\nsuccessfully visited states from the current RL policy, and the policy improves\nby learning from these demonstrations. In this way, we relieve the demand for\nhuman expert operators to collect demonstrations required by IL and improve the\nRL performance as well. Various experimental results show that SILP+ achieves\nbetter training efficiency higher and more stable success rate in complex\nmotion planning tasks compared to several other methods. Extensive tests on\nphysical robots illustrate the effectiveness of SILP+ in a physical setting.",

Experimental results show that our\napproach significantly outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in\nthe success rate of service tasks.

This knowledge goes\nbeyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal\nanalysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect\nrelationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and\nenable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this\nend, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons\nover a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions,\nunderstanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such\nreasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a\ngiven task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based\nsimulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions\nin shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot\ntrajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout,\nand robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator\nis general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a\ncase study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal\napproach against a non-causal baseline.

We study a class of\nproblems providing (1) low-entropy indicators of terminal success / failure,\nand (2) unreliable (high-entropy) data to predict the final outcome of an\nongoing task. Examples include a robot trying to connect with a charging\nstation, parallel parking, or assembling a tightly-fitting part. The ability to\nrestart after predicting failure early, versus simply running to failure, can\nsignificantly decrease the makespan, that is, the total time to completion,\nwith the drawback of potentially short-cutting an otherwise successful\noperation. Assuming task running times to be Poisson distributed, and using a\nMarkov Jump process to capture the dynamics of the underlying Markov Decision\nProcess, we derive a closed form solution that predicts makespan based on the\nconfusion matrix of the failure predictor. This allows the robot to learn\nfailure prediction in a production environment, and only adopt a preemptive\npolicy when it actually saves time. We demonstrate this approach using a\nrobotic peg-in-hole assembly problem using a real robotic system. Failures are\npredicted by a dilated convolutional network based on force-torque data,\nshowing an average makespan reduction from 101s to 81s (N=120, p<0.05).

This article\npresents the first experimental study exploring decision-making interactions\nbetween humans and robots with visual cues from robotic eyes, which can\ndynamically influence human opinion formation. The cues generated by robotic\neyes gradually guide human decisions towards alignment with the robot's\nchoices. Both human and robot decision-making processes are modeled as\nnon-linear opinion dynamics with evolving biases. To examine these opinion\ndynamics under varying biases, we conduct numerical parametric and equilibrium\ncontinuation analyses using tuned parameters designed explicitly for the\npresented human-robot interaction experiment. Furthermore, to facilitate the\ntransition from disagreement to agreement, we introduced a human opinion\nobservation algorithm integrated with the formation of the robot's opinion,\nwhere the robot's behavior is controlled based on its formed opinion. The\nalgorithms developed aim to enhance human involvement in consensus building,\nfostering effective collaboration between humans and robots. Experiments with\n51 participants (N = 51) show that human-robot teamwork can be improved by\nguiding human decisions using robotic cues. Finally, we provide detailed\ninsights on the effects of trust, cognitive load, and participant demographics\non decision-making based on user feedback and post-experiment interviews.",

An open question is whether two human operators can make better\ndecisions jointly, as compared to a single operator alone. While prior work has\nshown that two heads are better than one, such studies have been mostly limited\nto static and passive tasks. We investigate joint decision-making in a dynamic\ntask involving humans teleoperating robots. We conduct a human-subject\nexperiment with $N=100$ participants where each participant performed a\nnavigation task with two mobiles robots in simulation. We find that joint\ndecision-making through confidence sharing improves dyad performance beyond the\nbetter-performing individual (p<0.0001). Further, we find that the extent of\nthis benefit is regulated both by the skill level of each individual, as well\nas how well-calibrated their confidence estimates are. Finally, we present\nfindings on characterising the human-human dyad's confidence calibration based\non the individuals constituting the dyad. Our findings demonstrate for the\nfirst time that two heads are better than one, even on a spatiotemporal task\nwhich includes active operator control of robots.",

To address this gap,\nwe present SafeAgentBench-the first benchmark for safety-aware task planning of\nembodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments. SafeAgentBench\nincludes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks,\nrigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2)\nSafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller,\nsupporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8\nstate-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both\nexecution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although\nagents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in\ntask success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most\nsafety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10\\% rejection rate for detailed\nhazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not\nlead to notable improvements in safety awareness.

The synthetic\ndataset, featuring high-fidelity physics and photorealistic rendering, is\nconstructed through multiple approaches. Additionally, we propose unified\nbenchmarks for imitation learning and reinforcement learning, enabling\nevaluation across different levels of generalization. At the core of the\nsimulation platform is MetaSim, an infrastructure that abstracts diverse\nsimulation environments into a universal interface. It restructures existing\nsimulation environments into a simulator-agnostic configuration system, as well\nas an API aligning different simulator functionalities, such as launching\nsimulation environments, loading assets with initial states, stepping the\nphysics engine, etc. This abstraction ensures interoperability and\nextensibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RoboVerse enhances\nthe performance of imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world model\nlearning, and sim-to-real transfer. These results validate the reliability of\nour dataset and benchmarks, establishing RoboVerse as a robust solution for\nadvancing robot learning.",

This challenge\nis amplified when multi-task inference is expected on robots operating under\nstringent resource and real-time constraints. To address such a challenge, we\nintroduce RED, a systematic real-time scheduling approach designed to support\nmulti-task deep neural network workloads in resource-limited robotic systems.\nIt is designed to adaptively manage the Robotic Environmental Dynamics (RED)\nwhile adhering to real-time constraints. At the core of RED lies a\ndeadline-based scheduler that employs an intermediate deadline assignment\npolicy, effectively managing to change workloads and asynchronous inference\nprompted by complex, unpredictable environments. This scheduling framework also\nfacilitates the flexible deployment of MIMONet (multi-input multi-output neural\nnetworks), which are commonly utilized in multi-tasking robotic systems to\ncircumvent memory bottlenecks. Building on this scheduling framework, RED\nrecognizes and leverages a unique characteristic of MIMONet: its weight-shared\narchitecture. To further accommodate and exploit this feature, RED devises a\nnovel and effective workload refinement and reconstruction process.

We introduce Sirius-Fleet, a\nmulti-task interactive robot fleet learning framework to address these\nchallenges. Sirius-Fleet monitors robot performance during deployment and\ninvolves humans to correct the robot's actions when necessary. We employ a\nvisual world model to predict the outcomes of future actions and build anomaly\npredictors to predict whether they will likely result in anomalies.

            "abstract": "Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in robotics, with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) emerging as one of the most promising approaches for robot\ncontrol. However, several key challenges hinder its broader application. First,\nmany RL methods rely on online learning, which requires either real-world\nhardware or advanced simulation environments--both of which can be costly,\ntime-consuming, and impractical. Offline reinforcement learning offers a\nsolution, enabling models to be trained without ongoing access to physical\nrobots or simulations.\n  A second challenge is learning multi-goal tasks, where robots must achieve\nmultiple objectives simultaneously. This adds complexity to the training\nprocess, as the model must generalize across different goals. At the same time,\ntransformer architectures have gained significant popularity across various\ndomains, including reinforcement learning. Yet, no existing methods effectively\ncombine offline training, multi-goal learning, and transformer-based\narchitectures.\n  In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a novel adaptation\nof the decision transformer architecture for offline multi-goal reinforcement\nlearning in robotics. Our approach integrates goal-specific information into\nthe decision transformer, allowing it to handle complex tasks in an offline\nsetting. To validate our method, we developed a new offline reinforcement\nlearning dataset using the Panda robotic platform in simulation. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the decision transformer can outperform\nstate-of-the-art online reinforcement learning methods.",

Recent work has demonstrated\nthat AI systems trained on human data can exhibit similar reasoning biases as\nhumans and that AI can, in turn, bias human judgments through AI recommendation\nsystems. We evaluate the rationality of AI responses via a series of choice\nexperiments designed to evaluate transitivity of preference in humans. We\nconsidered ten versions of Meta's Llama 2 and 3 LLM models. We applied Bayesian\nmodel selection to evaluate whether these AI-generated choices violated two\nprominent models of transitivity. We found that the Llama 2 and 3 models\ngenerally satisfied transitivity, but when violations did occur, occurred only\nin the Chat/Instruct versions of the LLMs. We argue that rationality axioms,\nsuch as transitivity of preference, can be useful for evaluating and\nbenchmarking the quality of AI-generated responses and provide a foundation for\nunderstanding computational rationality in AI systems more generally.",

At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language\nmodels (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that\ninteract with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how\nperformant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform\nwork-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for\nboth industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy\nto understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To\nmeasure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world\nprofessional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible\nbenchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways\nto those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running\nprograms, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained\nenvironment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software\ncompany environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by\nworkers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed\nAPI-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most\ncompetitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints\na nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating\na real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously,\nbut more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current\nsystems.",

By examining each model's capabilities, we aim to\nprovide an insightful assessment of their strengths and limitations. Our paper\noffers benchmarks for financial report analysis, encompassing proposed metrics\nsuch as ROUGE-1, BERT Score, and LLM Score. We introduce an innovative\nevaluation framework that integrates both quantitative metrics (e.g.,\nprecision, recall) and qualitative analyses (e.g., contextual fit, consistency)\nto provide a holistic view of each model's output quality. Additionally, we\nmake our financial dataset publicly available, inviting researchers and\npractitioners to leverage, scrutinize, and enhance our findings through broader\ncommunity engagement and collaborative improvement.

We take a firm position: traditional\nbenchmarks are insufficient to ensure the reliability of LLM agents in finance.\nTo address this, we analyze existing financial LLM agent benchmarks, finding\nsafety gaps and introducing ten risk-aware evaluation metrics. Through an\nempirical evaluation of both API-based and open-weight LLM agents, we reveal\nhidden vulnerabilities that remain undetected by conventional assessments. To\nmove the field forward, we propose the Safety-Aware Evaluation Agent (SAEA),\ngrounded in a three-level evaluation framework that assesses agents at the\nmodel level (intrinsic capabilities), workflow level (multi-step process\nreliability), and system level (integration robustness). Our findings highlight\nthe urgent need to redefine LLM agent evaluation standards by shifting the\nfocus from raw performance to safety, robustness, and real world resilience.",

Our work attempts to solve this problem through\nlarge language model based agents.

The StockAgent allows users to\nevaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to\nanalyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent\navoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation\nsystems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging\nprior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate\ndifferent LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment\nthat closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading,\nincluding trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules.

The results that we highlight here could easily have been revealed\nat the time that the relevant key papers were published, more than a decade\nago, but the accepted methodology at the time of those publications involved a\nsomewhat minimal approach to experimental evaluation of trader-agents, making\nclaims on the basis of a few thousand test-sessions of the trader-agent in a\nsmall number of market scenarios. In this paper we present results from\nexhaustive testing over wide ranges of parameter values, using parallel\ncloud-computing facilities, where we conduct millions of tests and thereby\ncreate much richer data from which firmer conclusions can be drawn. We show\nthat the best public-domain AI/ML traders in the published literature can be\nroutinely outperformed by a \"sub-zero-intelligence\" trading strategy that at\nface value appears to be so simple as to be financially ruinous, but which\ninteracts with the market in such a way that in practice it is more profitable\nthan the well-known AI/ML strategies from the research literature.

We take a firm position: traditional\nbenchmarks are insufficient to ensure the reliability of LLM agents in finance.\nTo address this, we analyze existing financial LLM agent benchmarks, finding\nsafety gaps and introducing ten risk-aware evaluation metrics. Through an\nempirical evaluation of both API-based and open-weight LLM agents, we reveal\nhidden vulnerabilities that remain undetected by conventional assessments. To\nmove the field forward, we propose the Safety-Aware Evaluation Agent (SAEA),\ngrounded in a three-level evaluation framework that assesses agents at the\nmodel level (intrinsic capabilities), workflow level (multi-step process\nreliability), and system level (integration robustness). Our findings highlight\nthe urgent need to redefine LLM agent evaluation standards by shifting the\nfocus from raw performance to safety, robustness, and real world resilience.",

Knowing how the value of a certain sector\nmarket may move in the future provides much information for investors, as they\nuse that information to develop strategies to maximize profit or minimize risk.\nHowever, market data are quite noisy, and it is challenging to choose the right\ndata or the right model to create such predictions. With the rise of large\nlanguage models, there are ways to analyze certain data much more efficiently\nthan before.\n  Our goal is to determine whether the GPT model provides more useful\ninformation compared to other traditional transformer models, such as the BERT\nmodel. We shall use data from the Federal Reserve Beige Book, which provides\nsummaries of economic conditions in different districts in the US. Using such\ndata, we then employ the LLM's to make predictions on the correlations. Using\nthese correlations, we then compare the results with well-known strategies and\ndetermine whether knowing the economic conditions improves investment\ndecisions. We conclude that the Beige Book does contain information regarding\ncorrelations amongst different assets, yet the GPT model has too much\nlook-ahead bias and that traditional models still triumph.",

The\nrapid integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), offers opportunities to enhance the equity rating\nprocess. This paper explores the application of LLMs to generate multi-horizon\nstock ratings by ingesting diverse datasets. Traditional stock rating methods\nrely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several\nchallenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed\nreactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs\nto improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings. Additionally, we\nassess the efficacy of using different data modalities with LLMs for the\nfinancial domain.\n  We utilize varied datasets comprising fundamental financial, market, and news\ndata from January 2022 to June 2024, along with GPT-4-32k (v0613) (with a\ntraining cutoff in Sep. 2021 to prevent information leakage). Our results show\nthat our benchmark method outperforms traditional stock rating methods when\nassessed by forward returns, specially when incorporating financial\nfundamentals. While integrating news data improves short-term performance,\nsubstituting detailed news summaries with sentiment scores reduces token use\nwithout loss of performance. In many cases, omitting news data entirely\nenhances performance by reducing bias.\n  Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large\namounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at\nthe stock rating prediction task. Our work provides a reproducible and\nefficient framework for generating accurate stock ratings, serving as a\ncost-effective alternative to traditional methods.

            "abstract": "The stock price prediction task holds a significant role in the financial\ndomain and has been studied for a long time. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have brought new ways to improve these predictions. While recent\nfinancial large language models (FinLLMs) have shown considerable progress in\nfinancial NLP tasks compared to smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs),\nchallenges persist in stock price forecasting. Firstly, effectively integrating\nthe modalities of time series data and natural language to fully leverage these\ncapabilities remains complex. Secondly, FinLLMs focus more on analysis and\ninterpretability, which can overlook the essential features of time series\ndata. Moreover, due to the abundance of false and redundant information in\nfinancial markets, models often produce less accurate predictions when faced\nwith such input data. In this paper, we introduce StockTime, a novel LLM-based\narchitecture designed specifically for stock price data. Unlike recent FinLLMs,\nStockTime is specifically designed for stock price time series data. It\nleverages the natural ability of LLMs to predict the next token by treating\nstock prices as consecutive tokens, extracting textual information such as\nstock correlations, statistical trends and timestamps directly from these stock\nprices. StockTime then integrates both textual and time series data into the\nembedding space. By fusing this multimodal data, StockTime effectively predicts\nstock prices across arbitrary look-back periods. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat StockTime outperforms recent LLMs, as it gives more accurate predictions\nwhile reducing memory usage and runtime costs.",

In quantitative investing, return\nforecasting is fundamental for subsequent tasks like stock picking, portfolio\noptimization, etc. We formulate the model to include text representation and\nforecasting modules. We propose to compare the encoder-only and decoder-only\nLLMs, considering they generate text representations in distinct ways. The\nimpact of these different representations on forecasting performance remains an\nopen question. Meanwhile, we compare two simple methods of integrating LLMs'\ntoken-level representations into the forecasting module. The experiments on\nreal news and investment universes reveal that: (1) aggregated representations\nfrom LLMs' token-level embeddings generally produce return predictions that\nenhance the performance of long-only and long-short portfolios; (2) in the\nrelatively large investment universe, the decoder LLMs-based prediction model\nleads to stronger portfolios, whereas in the small universes, there are no\nconsistent winners. Among the three LLMs studied (DeBERTa, Mistral, Llama),\nMistral performs more robustly across different universes; (3) return\npredictions derived from LLMs' text representations are a strong signal for\nportfolio construction, outperforming conventional sentiment scores.",

We hypothesize that the\nhistorical market reactions to words, offer a more reliable indicator of their\npotential impact on markets than subjective sentiment interpretations by human\nannotators. To test this hypothesis, a market-derived labeling approach is\nproposed to assign tweet labels based on ensuing short-term price trends,\nenabling the language model to capture the relationship between textual signals\nand market dynamics directly. A domain-specific language model was fine-tuned\non these labels, achieving up to an 11% improvement in short-term trend\nprediction accuracy over traditional sentiment-based benchmarks. Moreover, by\nincorporating market and temporal context through prompt-tuning, the proposed\ncontext-aware language model demonstrated an accuracy of 89.6% on a curated\ndataset of 227 impactful Bitcoin-related news events with significant market\nimpacts. Aggregating daily tweet predictions into trading signals, our method\noutperformed traditional fusion models (which combine sentiment-based and\nprice-based predictions). It challenged the assumption that sentiment-based\nsignals are inferior to price-based predictions in forecasting market\nmovements. Backtesting these signals across three distinct market regimes\nyielded robust Sharpe ratios of up to 5.07 in trending markets and 3.73 in\nneutral markets.

However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors\nlose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha\nmining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay\nfrom overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language\nModels (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing\nknowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate\ndecay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous\nframework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations\nfor mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key\nmechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on\nabstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor\nalignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and\ngenerated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural\nconstraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to\noverfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process\nto balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving\nmarket conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations\nshow that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in\nmitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering\nsignificant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&P 500 markets over the past four\nyears. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay,\nelevating the potential for yielding powerful factors.",

In this paper we explore if large language models (LLMs) can\nplay games, investigating their capabilities for randomisation and strategic\nadaptation through both simultaneous and sequential game interactions. We focus\non GPT-4o-Mini-2024-08-17 and test two games between LLMs: Rock Paper Scissors\n(RPS) and games of strategy (Prisoners Dilemma PD). LLMs are often described as\nstochastic parrots, and while they may indeed be parrots, our results suggest\nthat they are not very stochastic in the sense that their outputs - when\nprompted to be random - are often very biased. Our research reveals that LLMs\nappear to develop loss aversion strategies in repeated games, with RPS\nconverging to stalemate conditions while PD shows systematic shifts between\ncooperative and competitive outcomes based on prompt design. We detail\nprogrammatic tools for independent agent interactions and the Agentic AI\nchallenges faced in implementation. We show that LLMs can indeed play games,\njust not very well. These results have implications for the use of LLMs in\nmulti-agent LLM systems and showcase limitations in current approaches to model\noutput for strategic decision-making.",

We propose that future AI agents should synthesize the\nstrengths of these specialized systems into a unified framework capable of\noperating across text, vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, emotional\nintelligence, and beyond. This integration is not only feasible but also\nessential for achieving the versatility and adaptability that characterize\nhuman intelligence.

To advance the field, we introduce CombatVLA, an\nefficient VLA model optimized for combat tasks in 3D action role-playing\ngames(ARPGs). Specifically, our CombatVLA is a 3B model trained on video-action\npairs collected by an action tracker, where the data is formatted as\naction-of-thought (AoT) sequences. Thereafter, CombatVLA seamlessly integrates\ninto an action execution framework, allowing efficient inference through our\ntruncated AoT strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that CombatVLA not\nonly outperforms all existing models on the combat understanding benchmark but\nalso achieves a 50-fold acceleration in game combat. Moreover, it has a higher\ntask success rate than human players. We will open-source all resources,\nincluding the action tracker, dataset, benchmark, model weights, training code,\nand the implementation of the framework at https://combatvla.github.io/.",

To address this, we introduce Visual-centric\nMultiple Abilities Game Evaluation (V-MAGE), a game-based evaluation framework\ndesigned to assess visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. V-MAGE features five\ndiverse games with 30+ handcrafted levels, testing models on core visual skills\nsuch as positioning, trajectory tracking, timing, and visual memory, alongside\nhigher-level reasoning like long-term planning and deliberation. We use V-MAGE\nto evaluate leading MLLMs, revealing significant challenges in their visual\nperception and reasoning. In all game environments, the top-performing MLLMs,\nas determined by Elo rating comparisons, exhibit a substantial performance gap\ncompared to humans. Our findings highlight critical limitations, including\nvarious types of perceptual errors made by the models, and suggest potential\navenues for improvement from an agent-centric perspective, such as refining\nagent strategies and addressing perceptual inaccuracies.

To advance the field, we introduce CombatVLA, an\nefficient VLA model optimized for combat tasks in 3D action role-playing\ngames(ARPGs).

To address this challenge,\nwe propose an algorithmic framework that fine-tunes VLMs with reinforcement\nlearning (RL). Specifically, our framework provides a task description and then\nprompts the VLM to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling the VLM\nto efficiently explore intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final\ntext-based action. Next, the open-ended text output is parsed into an\nexecutable action to interact with the environment to obtain goal-directed task\nrewards. Finally, our framework uses these task rewards to fine-tune the entire\nVLM with RL. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances\nthe decision-making capabilities of VLM agents across various tasks, enabling\n7b models to outperform commercial models such as GPT4-V or Gemini.\nFurthermore, we find that CoT reasoning is a crucial component for performance\nimprovement, as removing the CoT reasoning results in a significant decrease in\nthe overall performance of our method.",
